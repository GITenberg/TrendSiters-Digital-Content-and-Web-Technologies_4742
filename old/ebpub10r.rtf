\par \hich\af2\dbch\af23\loch\f2 Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)
\par 
\par \hich\af2\dbch\af23\loch\f2 We produ\hich\af2\dbch\af23\loch\f2 ce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
\par \hich\af2\dbch\af23\loch\f2 time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
\par \hich\af2\dbch\af23\loch\f2 to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
\par \hich\af2\dbch\af23\loch\f2 searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
\par \hich\af2\dbch\af23\loch\f2 projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
\par \hich\af2\dbch\af23\loch\f2 per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
\par \hich\af2\dbch\af23\loch\f2 million dollars per hour in 2001 as we release over 50 new Etext
\par \hich\af2\dbch\af23\loch\f2 files per month, or 500 more Etexts in 2000 for a total of\hich\af2\dbch\af23\loch\f2  4000+
\par \hich\af2\dbch\af23\loch\f2 If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
\par \hich\af2\dbch\af23\loch\f2 should reach over 300 billion Etexts given away by year's end.
\par 
\par \hich\af2\dbch\af23\loch\f2 The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
\par \hich\af2\dbch\af23\loch\f2 Files by December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000\hich\af2\dbch\af23\loch\f2  = 1 Trillion]
\par \hich\af2\dbch\af23\loch\f2 This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
\par \hich\af2\dbch\af23\loch\f2 which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.
\par 
\par \hich\af2\dbch\af23\loch\f2 At our revised rates of production, we will reach only one-third
\par \hich\af2\dbch\af23\loch\f2 of that goal by the end of 2001, or about\hich\af2\dbch\af23\loch\f2  4,000 Etexts.  We need
\par \hich\af2\dbch\af23\loch\f2 funding, as well as continued efforts by volunteers, to maintain
\par \hich\af2\dbch\af23\loch\f2 or increase our production and reach our goals.
\par 
\par \hich\af2\dbch\af23\loch\f2 The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created
\par \hich\af2\dbch\af23\loch\f2 to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into \hich\af2\dbch\af23\loch\f2 the next millennium.

\par \~
\par }{\f1\fs20 ""Non-periodical printed publication of at least 49 pages excluding covers". }{
\par \~
\par }{\f1\fs20 The emergence of electronic publishing was supposed to change all that. Yet a bloodbath of unusual proportions has taken place in the last few months. Time Warner's iPublish and\~Might
yWords (partly owned by Barnes and Noble) were the last in a string of resounding failures which cast in doubt the business model underlying digital content. Everything seemed to have gone wrong: the dot.coms dot bombed, venture capital dried up, competin
g standards fractured an already fragile marketplace, the hardware (e-book readers) was clunky and awkward, the software unwieldy, the e-books badly written or already in the public domain. }{
\par \~
\par }{\f1\fs20 Terrified by the inexorable process of disintermediation (the es
tablishment of direct contact between author and readers, excluding publishers and bookstores) and by the ease with which digital content can be replicated - publishers resorted to draconian copyright protection measures (euphemistically known as "digital
 rights management"). This further alienated the few potential readers left. The opposite model of "viral" or "buzz" marketing (by encouraging the dissemination of free copies of the promoted book) was only marginally more successful. }{
\par \~
\par }{\f1\fs20 Moreover, e-publishing's delivery platform, the Internet, has been transformed beyond recognition since March 2000. }{
\par \~
\par }{\f1\fs20 From an open, somewhat anarchic, web of networked computers - it has evolved into a territorial, commercial, corporate extension of "brick and mortar" giants, subject to\~government regulation. It\~is less friendly towards\~
independent (small) publishers, the backbone of e-publishing. Increasingly, it is expropriated by publishing and media behemoths. It is treated as a medium for cross promotion, supply chain management, and customer relations management.\~It offers\~
only some minor synergies with\~non-cyberspace, real world, franchises and media properties. The likes of Disney and Bertelsmann\~have swung a full circle from\~considering the Internet to be the next big thing in New Media delivery - to frantic\~
efforts to contain the red ink it oozed all over their otherwise impeccable balance sheets.}{
\par \~
\par }{\f1\fs20 But were the now silent pundits right all the same? Is the future of publishing (and other media industries) inextricably intertwined with the Internet?}{
\par \~
\par }{\f1\fs20 The answer depends on whether an old habit dies hard. Internet\~surfers are used to free content. They are very reluctant to pay for information (with precious few exceptions, like the "Wall Street Journal"'s electronic e
dition). Moreover, the Internet, with 3 billion pages listed in the Google search engine (and another 15 billion in "invisible" databases), provides many free substitutes to every information product, no matter how superior. Web based media companies (suc
h as Salon and Britannica.com) have been experimenting with payment and pricing models. But this is besides the point. Whether in the form of subscription (Britannica), pay per view (Questia), pay\~
to print (Fathom), sample and pay to buy the physical product\~(RealRead), or micropayments (Amazon) - the public refuses to cough up. }{
\par \~
\par }{\f1\fs20 Moreover, the advertising-subsidized free content Web site has died together with Web advertising. Geocities - a community of free hosted, ad-supported, Web sites purchased by Yah
oo! - is now selectively shutting down Web sites (when they exceed a certain level of traffic) to convince their owners to revert to a monthly hosting fee model. With Lycos in trouble in Europe, Tripod may well follow suit shortly. Earlier this year, Micr
o
soft has shut down ListBot (a host of discussion lists). Suite101 has stopped paying its editors (content authors) effective January 15th. About.com fired hundreds of category editors. With the ugly demise of Themestream, WebSeed is the only content aggre
gator which tries to buck the trend by relying (partly) on advertising revenue.}{
\par \~
\par }{\f1\fs20 Paradoxically, e-publishing's main hope may lie with its ostensible adversary: the library. Unbelievably, e-publishers actually tried to limit the access\~of library patrons\~
to e-books (i.e., the lending of e-books to multiple patrons). But, libraries are not only repositories of knowledge and community centres. They are also dominant promoters of new knowledge technologies. They are already the largest buyers of e-books. Tog
e
ther with schools and other educational institutions, libraries can serve as decisive socialization agents and introduce generations of pupils, students, and readers to the possibilities and riches of e-publishing. Government use of e-books (e.g., by the 
military) may have the same beneficial effect.}{
\par \~
\par }{\f1\fs20 As standards converge (Adobe's Portable Document Format and Microsoft's MS Reader LIT format are likely to be the winners), as hardware improves and becomes ubiquitous (within multi-purpose devices or as stan
dalone higher quality units), as content becomes more attractive (already many new titles are published in both print and electronic formats), as more versatile information taxonomies (like the Digital Object Identifier) are introduced, as the\~
Internet becomes more gender-neutral,\~polyglot,\~and cosmopolitan\~- e-publishing is likely to recover and flourish. }{
\par \~
\par }{\f1\fs20 This renaissance will probably be aided by the gradual decline of print magazines and by a strengthening movement for free open source scholarly publishing. The publishing of periodical content and academic\~
research (including, gradually, peer reviewed research) may be already shifting to the Web. Non-fiction and textbooks will follow.\~Alternative models of pricing are already in evidence (author pays to publish, author pays to\~
obtain peer review, publisher pays to publish, buy a physical product and gain access to enhanced online content, and so on). Web site rating agencies\~will help to discriminate between the credible and the in-credible. Publishing 
is moving - albeit kicking and screaming - online.}{

\par }{\cs15\b\f1 {\*\bkmkend disintermediation}By: Sam Vaknin}{
\par \~
\par }{\f1\fs20 Are content brokers - publishers, distributors, and record companies - a thing of the past?}{
\par \~
\par }{\f1\fs20 In one word: disintermediation}{
\par \~
\par }{\f1\fs20 The gradual removal of layers of content brokering and intermediation - mainly in manufacturing marketing - is the continuation of a long term trend. Consider music for instance. Streaming audio on the internet ("soft radio
"), or downloadable MP3 files may render the CD obsolete - but they were preceded by radio music broadcasts. But the novelty is that the Internet provides a venue for the marketing of niche products and reduces the barriers to entry previously imposed by 
the need to invest in costly "branding" campaigns and manufacturing and distribution activities.}{
\par \~
\par }{\f1\fs20 This trend is also likely to restore the balance between artists and the commercial exploiters of their products. The very definition of "artist" will expand 
to encompass all creative people. One will seek to distinguish oneself, to "brand" oneself and to auction one's services, ideas, products, designs, experience, physique, or biography, etc. directly to end-users and consumers. This is a return to pre-indus
trial times when artisans ruled the economic scene. Work stability will suffer and work mobility will increase in a landscape of shifting allegiances, head hunting, remote collaboration, and similar labour market trends.}{
\par \~
\par }{\f1\fs20 But distributors, publishers, and 
record companies are not going to vanish. They are going to metamorphose. This is because they fulfil a few functions and provide a few services whose importance is only enhanced by the "free for all" Internet culture.}{
\par \~
\par }{\f1\fs20 Content intermediaries grade conten
t and separate the qualitative from the ephemeral and the atrocious. The deluge of self-published and vanity published e-books, music tracks and art works has generated few masterpieces and a lot of trash. The absence of judicious filtering has unjustly g
i
ven a bad name to whole segments of the industry (e.g., small, or web-based publishers). Consumers - inundated, disappointed and exhausted - will pay a premium for content rating services. Though driven by crass commercial considerations, most publishers 
and record companies do apply certain quality standards routinely and thus are positioned to provide these rating services reliably.}{
\par \~
\par }{\f1\fs20 Content brokers are relationship managers. Consider distributors: they provide instant access to centralized, continuously
 updated, "addressbooks" of clients (stores, consumers, media, etc.). This reduces the time to market and increases efficiency. It alters revenue models very substantially. Content creators can thus concentrate on what they do best: content creation, and 
r
educe their overhead by outsourcing the functions of distribution and relationships management. The existence of central "relationship ledgers" yields synergies which can be applied to all the clients of the distributor. The distributor provides a single 
address that content re-sellers converge on and feed off. Distributors, publishers and record companies also provide logistical support: warehousing, consolidated sales reporting and transaction auditing, and a single, periodic payment.}{
\par \~
\par }{\f1\fs20 Yet, having said a
ll that, content intermediaries still over-charge their clients (the content creators) for their services. This is especially true in an age of just-in-time inventory and digital distribution. Network effects mean that content brokers have to invest much 
l
ess in marketing, branding and advertising once a product's first mover advantage is established. Economic laws of increasing, rather than diminishing, returns mean that every additional unit sold yields a HIGHER profit - rather than a declining one. The 
pie is getting bigger.}{
\par \~
\par }{\f1\fs20 Hence, the meteoric increase in royalties publishers pay authors from sales of the electronic versions of their work (anywhere from Random House's 35% to 50% paid by smaller publishers). As this tectonic shift reverberates through t
he whole distribution chain, retail outlets are beginning to transact directly with content creators. The borders between the types of intermediaries are blurred. Barnes and Noble (the American bookstores chain) has, in effect, become a publisher. Many pu
blishers have virtual storefronts. Many authors sell directly to their readers, acting as publishers. The introduction of "book ATMs" - POD (Print On Demand) machines, which will print \line 
every conceivable title in minutes, on the spot, in "book kiosks" - wil
l give rise to a host of new intermediaries. Intermediation is not gone. It is here to stay because it is sorely needed. But it is in a state of flux. Old maxims break down. New modes of operation emerge. }{

\par }{\f1\fs20\cf17 Some companies are gambling on content distribution and the possession of the attendant digital infrastructure. MightyWords, for example,\~
stealthily transformed itself from a "free-for-all-everyone-welcome" e-publisher to a distribution channel of choice works (mainly by midlist authors). It now aims to feed\~
its content to content-starved web sites. In the process, it shed thousands of unfortunate authors who did not meet its (never stated) sales criteria. }{
\par \~
\par }{\f1\fs20\cf17 Others bet the farm on content creation and packaging. Bn.com invaded the digital publishing and POD (Print on Demand) businesses in a series of lightning\~purchases. It is now the largest e-book store by a wide margin.}{
\par \~
\par }{\f1\fs20\cf17 But Amazon seemed to have got it right once more. The web's own virtual mall and\~the\~former darling of Wall Street has diversified into micropayments.}{
\par \~
\par }{\f1\fs20\cf17 The Internet started as a free medium for free spirits. E-commerce was once considered a dirty word. Web surfers became used to free content. Hence the (very low) glass ceiling on the price of content mad
e available through the web - and the need to charge\~customers less than 1 US dollars to a few dollars\~per transaction\~
("micro-payments"). Various service providers (such as Pay-Pal) emerged, none became sufficiently dominant and all-pervasive to constitute a standard.\~Web merchants' ability\~
to accept micropayments is crucial. E-commerce (let alone m-commerce) will never take off without it.}{
\par \~
\par }{\f1\fs20\cf17 Enter Amazon.\~Its "Honour System" is licenced to third party web sites (such as Bartleby.com and SatireWire). It al
lows people to donate money or effect micro-payments, apparently through its patented one-click system. As far as the web sites are concerned, there are two major drawbacks: all donations and payments are refundable within 30 days and Amazon charges them 
15 cents per transaction plus 15(!) percent. By far the worst deal in town.}{
\par \~
\par }{\f1\fs20\cf17 So, why the fuss?}{
\par \~
\par }{\f1\fs20\cf17 Because of Amazon's customer list. This development emphasizes the growing realization that\~one's list of customers - properly data mined -\~is the greatest ass
et, greater even than original content and more important than distribution channels and digital right management or asset management applications. Merchants are willing to pay for access to this ever expanding virtual neighbourhood (even if they are not 
made privy to the\~customer information collected by Amazon).\~}{
\par \~
\par }{\f1\fs20\cf17 The Honour System looks suspiciously similar to the payment system designed by Amazon for Stephen King's serialized e-novel, "The Plant". Interesting to note\~how the needs of authors and publis
hers are now in the driver's seat, helping to spur along\~innovations in business methods.\~}{

Scindex's Instant Publishing Service is about empowerment. The price of scholarly, peer-reviewed journals has skyrocketed in the last few years, often way out of the limited means of libraries, universities, individual scientists and scholars. A "scholarl
y divide" has opened between the haves (academic institutions with rich endowments and well-heeled corporations) and the haves not (all the others). Paradoxically, access to authoritative and authenticated knowledge has\~
declined as the number of professional journals has proliferated. This is not to mention the long (and often crucial) delays in publishing research results and the shoddy work of many under-paid and over-worked peer reviewers.}{
\par \~
\par }{\f1\fs20\cf17 The Internet was suppose to change all that. Originally, a compu
ter network for the exchange of (restricted and open) research results among scientists and academics in participating institutions - it was supposed to provide instant publishing, instant access and instant gratification. It has delivered only partially.
 Preprints of academic papers are often placed online by their eager authors and subjected to peer scrutiny. But this haphazard publishing cottage industry did nothing to dethrone the print incumbents and their avaricious pricing. }{
\par \~
\par }{\f1\fs20\cf17 The major missing eleme
nt is, of course, respectability. But there are others. No agreed upon content or knowledge classification method has emerged. Some web sites (such as Suite101) use the Dewey decimal system. Others invented and implemented systems of their making. Additio
nally, one click publishing technology (such as Webseed's or Blogger's)\~came to be identified\~strictly to non-scholarly material: personal reminiscences, correspondence, articles and news.}{
\par \~
\par }{\f1\fs20\cf17 Enter Scindex and its Academic Resource Channel. Established by ac
ademics and software experts from Bulgaria, it epitomizes the tearing down of geographical barriers heralded by the Internet. But it does much more than that. Scindex is a whole, self-contained, stand-alone, instant self-publishing and self-assembly syste
m. Self-publishing systems do exist (for instance, Purdue University's) - but they incorporate only certain components. Scindex covers the whole range.}{
\par \~
\par }{\f1\fs20\cf17 Having (freely) registered as a member, a scientist or a scholar can\~publish\~their papers, essays, research results, articles and comments online.\~
They have to submit an abstract and use Sciendex's classification ("call") numbers and science descriptors, arranged in a massive directory available in\~the "RealSci Locator".\~The Locator\~can\~be also downloaded a
nd used off-line and its is surprisingly user-friendly. The submission process itself is totally automated and very short.}{
\par \~
\par }{\f1\fs20\cf17 The system includes a long series of thematic journals. These journals self-assemble, in accordance with the call numbers selected by the submitters. An article submitted with\~
certain call numbers will automatically be included in the relevant journals. }{
\par \~
\par }{\f1\fs20\cf17 The fly in the ointment is the absence of peer review. As the system moves from beta to commercialization, Scindex intends to addr
ess this issue by introducing a system of incentives and inducements. Reviewers will be granted "credit points" to be applied against the (paid) publication of their own papers, for instance. }{
\par \~
\par }{\f1\fs20\cf17 Scindex is the model of things to come.\~Publishing becomes more and more automated and knowledge-orientated. Peer reviewed papers become more\~outlandishly expensive and irrelevant.\~Scientists and scholars\~
are getting impatient and rebellious. The confluence of these three trends spells - at the least - the creation of a web based universe of parallel\~and alternative scholarly publishing. }{

- like cheater.com, cheatweb\~or cheathouse.com - make no bones about their offerings. Many of them are located outside the USA (in Germany, or Asia) and at least one offers papers in a few languages, Hebrew included.}{

\par }{\f1\fs20 The problem, though, is not l
imited to the ivory towers. E-zines plagiarize. The print media plagiarize. Individual journalists plagiarize, many with abandon. Even advertising agencies and financial institutions plagiarize. The amount of material out there is so overwhelming that the
 plagiarist develops a (fairly justified) sense of\~immunity. The temptation\~is irresistible, the rewards big and the pressures of\~modern\~life great.}{
\par \~
\par }{\f1\fs20 Some of the plagiarists are straightforward copiers. Others substitute words, add sentences, or combine two or more sources. This raises the question: "when\~
should content be considered original and when - plagiarized?". Should the test for plagiarism be more stringent than the one applied by the Copyright Office? And what rights are implicitly granted by the material's\~genuine authors or publishers once\~
they place the content on the Internet? Is the Web a public domain and, if yes, to what extent? These questions are not easily answered. Consider reports generated by users from a database. Are these reports co
pyrighted - and if so, by whom - by the database compiler or by the user who defined the parameters, without which the reports in question would have never been generated? What about "fair use" of text and works of art? In the USA, the backlash against di

- often lead to the purchase of a licence. Not so with plagiarism. The identities of the author, editor, publisher and illustrator 
are deleted and replaced by the details of the plagiarist. And while piracy is discussed freely and fought vigorously - the discussion of plagiarism is still taboo and\~

\par }{\f1\fs20 
The recent bloodbath among online content peddlers and digital media proselytisers can be traced to two deadly sins. The first was to assume that traffic equals sales. In other words, that a miraculous conversion will spontaneously occur among the hordes 
of visitors to a web site.\~It was taken as an article of faith that\~
a certain percentage of this mass will inevitably and nigh hypnotically reach for their bulging pocketbooks and purchase content, however packaged. Moreover, ad revenues (more reasonably) w
ere assumed to be closely correlated with "eyeballs". This myth led to an obsession with counters, page hits, impressions, unique visitors, statistics and demographics. }{
\par \~
\par }{\f1\fs20 It failed, however, to take into account the dwindling efficacy of what Seth Godin, 
in his brilliant essay ("Unleashing the IdeaVirus"), calls "Interruption Marketing" - ads, banners, spam and fliers. It also ignored, at its peril, the ethos of free content and open source prevalent among the Internet opinion leaders, movers and shapers.
 These two neglected aspects of Internet hype and culture led to the trouncing of erstwhile promising web media companies\~while their business models were exposed as wishful thinking. }{
\par \~
\par }{\f1\fs20 The second mistake was to exclusively cater to the needs of a highly i
diosyncratic group of people (Silicone Valley geeks and nerds). The assumption that the USA (let alone the rest of the world) is Silicone Valley writ large proved to be calamitous to the industry. }{
\par \~
\par }{\f1\fs20 In the 1970s and 1980s, evolutionary biologists like Ric
hard Dawkins and Rupert Sheldrake developed models of cultural evolution. Dawkins' "meme" is a cultural element (like a behaviour or an idea) passed from one individual to another and from one generation to another not through biological -genetic means - 
but by imitation. Sheldrake added the notion of\~
contagion - "morphic resonance" - which causes behaviour patterns to suddenly emerged in whole populations. Physicists talked about sudden "phase transitions", the emergent results of a critical mass reached. 
A latter day thinker, Michael Gladwell, called it the "tipping point".}{
\par \~
\par }{\f1\fs20 Seth Godin invented the concept of an "ideavirus" and an attendant marketing terminology. In a nutshell, he says, to use his own summation: }{
\par \~
\par }{\f1\fs20 "Marketing by interrupting people isn't 
cost-effective anymore. You can't afford to seek out people and send them unwanted marketing, in large groups and hope that some will send you money. Instead the future belongs to marketers who establish a foundation and process where interested people ca
n market to each other. Ignite consumer networks and then get out of the way and let them talk."}{
\par \~
\par }{\f1\fs20 This is sound advice with a shaky conclusion. The conversion from exposure to a marketing message (even from peers within a consumer network) - to an actual\~s
ale is a convoluted, multi-layered, highly complex process. It is not a "black box", better left unattended to. It is the same deadly sin all over again - the belief in a miraculous conversion. And it is highly US-centric. People in other parts of the wor
ld interact entirely differently.}{
\par \~
\par }{\f1\fs20 You can get them to visit and you get them to talk and you can get them to excite others. But to get them to buy - is a whole different ballgame. Dot.coms had better begin to study its rules.}{

\par \~
\par \line }{\f1\fs20 A debate is raging in e-publishing circles: should content be encrypted and protected (the Barnes and Noble or Digital goods model) - or should it be distributed freely and thus serve as a form of viral marketing (Seth G
odin's "ideavirus")? Publishers fear that freely distributed and cost-free "cracked" e-books will cannibalize print books to oblivion. }{
\par \~
\par }{\f1\fs20 The more paranoid point at the music industry. It failed to co-opt the emerging peer-to-peer platforms (Napster) and t
o offer a viable digital assets management system with an equitable sharing of royalties. The results? A protracted legal battle and piracy run amok. "Publishers" - goes this creed - "are positioned to incorporate encryption and protection measures at the
 very inception of the digital publishing industry. They ought to learn the lesson." }{
\par \~
\par }{\f1\fs20 But this view ignores a vital difference between sound and text. In music, what matter are the song or the musical piece. The medium (or carrier, or packing) is marginal
 and interchangeable. A CD, an audio cassette, or an MP3 player are all fine, as far as the consumer is concerned. The listener bases his or her purchasing decisions on sound quality and the faithfulness of reproduction of the listening experience (for in
stance, in a concert hall). This is a very narrow, rational, measurable and quantifiable criterion. }{
\par \~
\par }{\f1\fs20 Not so with text. }{
\par \~
\par }{\f1\fs20 Content is only one element of many of equal footing underlying the decision to purchase a specific text-"carrier" (medium). Various 
media encapsulating IDENTICAL text will still fare differently. Hence the failure of CD-ROMs and e-learning. People tend to consume content in other formats or media, even if it is fully available to them or even owned by them in one specific medium. Peop
l
e prefer to pay to listen to live lectures rather than read freely available online transcripts. Libraries buy print journals even when they have subscribed to the full text online versions of the very same publications. And consumers overwhelmingly prefe
r to purchase books in print rather than their e-versions. }{
\par \~
\par }{\f1\fs20 This is partly a question of the slow demise of old habits. E-books have yet to develop the user-friendliness, platform-independence, porta
bility, browsability and many other attributes of this ingenious medium, the Gutenberg tome. But it also has to do with marketing psychology.\~
 Where text (or text equivalents, such as speech) is concerned, the medium is at least as important as the message. And this will hold true even when e-books catch up with their print brethren technologically. }{
\par \~
\par }{\f1\fs20 There is no doubting that finally e-books will surpass print books as a medium and offer numerous options:\~ hyperlinks within the e-book and without it - to 
web content, reference works, etc., embedded instant shopping and ordering links, divergent, user-interactive, decision driven plotlines, interaction with other e-books (using Bluetooth or another wireless standard), collaborative authoring, gaming and co
m
munity activities, automatically or periodically updated content, ,multimedia capabilities, database, Favourites and History Maintenance (records of reading habits, shopping habits, interaction with other readers, plot related decisions and much more), au
tomatic and embedded audio conversion and translation capabilities, full wireless piconetworking and scatternetworking capabilities and more. }{
\par \~
\par }{\f1\fs20 The same textual content will be available in the future in various media. Ostensibly, consumers should gravitat
e to the feature-rich and much cheaper e-book. But they won't - because the medium is as important as the text message. It is not enough to own the same content, or to gain access to the same message. Ownership of the right medium does count. Print books 
o
ffer connectivity within an historical context (tradition). E-books are cold and impersonal, alienated and detached. The printed word offers permanence. Digital text is ephemeral (as anyone whose writings perished in the recent dot.com bloodbath or Deja t
a
keover by Google can attest). Printed volumes are a whole sensorium, a sensual experience - olfactory and tactile and visual. E-books are one dimensional in comparison. These are differences that cannot be overcome, not even with the advent of digital "in
k" on digital "paper". They will keep the print book alive and publishers' revenues flowing. }{
\par \~
\par }{\f1\fs20 People buy printed matter not merely because of its content. If this were true e-books will have won the day. Print books are a packaged experience, the substanc
e of life. People buy the medium as often and as much as they buy the message it encapsulates. It is impossible to compete with this mistique. Safe in this knowledge, publishers should let go and impose on e-books "encryption" and "protection" levels as r
igorous as they do on the their print books. The latter are here to stay alongside the former. With the proper pricing and a modicum of trust, e-books may even end up promoting the old and trusted print versions.}{

\par \~
\par There is no source of reference remotely as authoritative as the Encyclopaedia Britannica. There is no brand as venerable and as veteran as this mammoth labour of knowl
edge and ideas established in 1768. There is no better value for money. And, after a few sputters and bugs, it now comes in all shapes and sizes, including two CD-ROM versions (standard and deluxe) and an appealing and reader-friendly web site. So, why do
es it always appear to be on the brink of extinction?
\par \~
\par The Britannica provides for an interesting study of the changing fortunes (and formats) of vendors of reference. As late as a decade ago, it was still selling in a leather-imitation bound set of 32 vol
umes. As print encyclopaedias went, it was a daring innovator and a pioneer of hyperlinked-like textual design. It sported a subject index, a lexical part and an alphabetically arranged series of in-depth essays authored by the best in every field of huma
n erudition. 
\par \~
\par When the CD-ROM erupted on the scene, the Britannica mismanaged the transition. As late as 1997, it was still selling a sordid text-only compact disc which included a part of the encyclopaedia. Only in 1998, did the Britannica switch to mult
imedia and added tables and graphs to the CD. Video and sound were to make their appearance even later. This error in trend analysis left the field wide open to the likes of Encarta and Grolier. The Britannica failed to grasp the irreversible shift from c
umbersome print volumes to slender and freely searchable CD-ROMs. Reference was going digital and the Britannica's sales plummeted.
\par \~
\par The Britannica was also late to cash on the web revolution - but, when it did, it became a world leader overnight. Its unbe
atable brand was a decisive factor. A failed experiment with an annoying subscription model gave way to unrestricted access to the full contents of the Encyclopaedia and much more besides: specially commissioned articles, fora, an annotated internet guide
, news in context, downloads and shopping. The site enjoys healthy traffic and the Britannica's CD-ROM interacts synergistically with its contents (through hyperlinks).
\par \~
\par Yet, recently, the Britannica had to fire hundreds of workers (in its web division) an
d a return to a pay-for-content model is contemplated. What went wrong again? Internet advertising did. The Britannica's revenue model was based on monetizing eyeballs, to use a faddish refrain. When the perpetuum mobile of "advertisers pay for content an
d users get it free" crumbled - the Britannica found itself in familiar dire straits.
\par \~
\par Is there a lesson to be learned from this arduous and convoluted tale? Are works of reference not self-supporting regardless of the revenue model (subscription, ad-based, print, CD-ROM)? This might well be the case. 
\par \~
\par Classic works of reference - from Diderot to the Encarta - offered a series of advantages to their users:
\par \~
\par 1. Authority - Works of reference are authored by experts in their fields and peer-reviewed. This ensures both objectivity and accuracy.
\par \~
\par 2. Accessibility - Huge amounts of material were assembled under one "roof". This abolished the need to scour numerous sources of variable quality to obtain the data one needed.
\par \~
\par 3. Organization - This pile of knowledge was organized in a convenient and recognizable manner (alphabetically or by subject)
\par \~
\par Moreover, authoring an encyclopaedia was such a daunting and expe
nsive task that only states, academic institutions, or well-funded businesses were able to produce them. At any given period there was a dearth of reliable encyclopaedias, which exercised a monopoly on the dissemination of knowledge. Competitors were few 
a
nd far between. The price of these tomes was, therefore, always exorbitant but people paid it to secure education for their children and a fount of knowledge at home. Hence the long gone phenomenon of "door to door encyclopaedia salesmen" and instalment p
lans.
\par \~
\par Yet, all these advantages were eroded to fine dust by the Internet. The web offers a plethora of highly authoritative information authored and released by the leading names in every field of human knowledge and endeavour. The Internet, is, in effect
, an encyclopaedia - far more detailed, far more authoritative, and far more comprehensive that any encyclopaedia can ever hope to be. The web is also fully accessible and fully searchable. What it lacks in organization it compensates in breadth and depth
 
and recently emergent subject portals (directories such as Yahoo! or The Open Directory) have become the indices of the Internet. The aforementioned anti-competition barriers to entry are gone: web publishing is cheap and immediate. Technologies such as w
eb communities, chat, and e-mail enable \line massive collaborative efforts. And, most important, the bulk of the Internet is free. Users pay only the communication costs.
\par \~
\par The long-heralded transition from free content to fee-based information may revive the f
ortunes of online reference vendors. But as long as the Internet - with its 2,000,000,000 (!) visible pages (and 5 times as many pages in its databases) - is free, encyclopaedias have little by way of a competitive advantage.

\par }{\cs15\b\f1 1. Content Suppliers }{\f1\fs20 
\par }{\cs15\b\f1 The Ethos of Free Content}{\f1  }{\f1\fs20 
\par Content Suppliers is the underprivileged sector of the Internet. They all lose money (even sites which offer basic, standardized goods - bo
oks, CDs), with the exception of sites profering sex or tourism. No user seems to begrateful for the effort and resources invested in creating and distributingcontent. The recent breakdown of traditional roles (between publisher andauthor, record company 
a
nd singer, etc.) and the direct access the creative artist is gaining to its paying public may change this attitude of ingratitude but hitherto there are scarce signs of that. Moreover, it is either quality of presentation (which only a publisher can affo
r
d) or ownership and (often shoddy) dissemination of content by the author. A really qualitative, fully commerce enabled site costs up to 5,000,000 USD,excluding site maintenance and customer and visitor services. Despite theseheavy outlays, site designers
 
are constantly criticized for lack of creativity or for too much creativity. More and more is asked of content purveyors and creators. They are exploited by intermediaries, hitchhikersand other parasites. This is all an off-shoot of the ethos of the Inter
netas a free content area. 
\par Most of the users like to surf (browse, visit sites) the net without reason or goal in mind. This makes it difficult to apply to the web traditional marketing techniques. 
\par What is the meaning of "targeted audiences" or "market shares" in this context? If a surfer visits sites which deal with aberrant sex and nuclear physics in the same session - what to make of it? 
\par Moreover, the public and legislative backlash against the gathering of surfer's data by Internet ad agencies and other web sites - has led to growing ignorance regarding the profile of Internet users, their demography, habits, preferences and dislikes. 

\par "Free" is a key word on the Internet : it used to belong to the US Government and to a bunch of universities. Users li
ke information, with emphasis on news and data about new products. But they do not like to shop on the net - yet. Only 38% of all surfers made a purchase during 1998. 
\par It would seem that users will not pay for content unless it is unavailable elsewhere or qualitatively rare or made rare. One way to "rarefy" content is to review and rate it. 
\par }{\cs15\b\f1 2. Quality-rated Content }{\f1\fs20 
\par There is a long term trend of clutter-breaking website-rating and critique. It may have a limited influence on the consumption decisions of so
me users and on their willingness to pay for content. Browsers already sport "What's New" and "What's Hot" buttons. Most Search Engines and directories recommend specific sites. But users are still cautious. Studies discovered that no user, no matter how 
h
eavy, has consistently re-visited more than 200 sites,a minuscule number. Some recommendation services often produce random - at times, wrong - selections for their users. There are also concerns regardingprivacy issues. The backlash against Amazon's "rea
d
ers circles" is an example. Web Critics, who work today mainly for the printed press, publishtheir wares on the net and collaborate with intelligent software whichhyperlinks to web sites, recommends them and refers users to them. Some web critics (guides)
 became identified with specific applications - really,expert systems -which incorporate their knowledge and experience. Most volunteer-based directories (such as the "Open Directory" and the late "Go" directory) work this way. 
\par The flip side of the coin of content consumption is investment in content creation, marketing, distribution and maintenance. 
\par }{\cs15\b\f1 3. The Money }{\f1\fs20 
\par Where is the capital needed to finance content likely to come from? 
\par Again, there are two schools: 
\par According to the first, sites will be financed through advertising -\~ and so will search engines and other applications accessed by users. 
\par Certain ASPs (Application Service Providers which rent out access to application software which resides on their servers) are considering this model. 
\par The recent collapse in online advertising rates and click-through rates raised serious doubts regarding the validity and viability of this model. Marketing gurus, such as Seth Godin went as far as declaring "interruption marketing" (=ads
 and banners) dead. 
\par The second approach is simpler and allows for the existence of non-commercial content. 
\par It proposes to collect negligible sums (cents or fractions of cents) from every user for every visit ("micro-payments"). These accumulated cents wi
ll enable the site-owners to update and to maintain them and encourage entrepreneurs to develop new content and invest in it. Certain content aggregators (especially of digital textbooks) have adopted this model (Questia, Fathom). 
\par The adherents of the first school point to the 5 million USD invested in advertising during 1995 and to the 60 million or so invested during 1996. 
\par Its opponents point exactly at the same numbers : ridiculously small when contrasted with more conventional advertising modes. The p
otential of advertising on thenet is limited to 1.5 billion USD annually in 1998, thundered the pessimists. The actual figure was double the prediction but still woefully small and inadequate to support the internet's content development. Comparethese fig
ures to the sale of Internet software (4 billion), Internet hardware (3 billion), Internet access provision (4.2 billion in 1995 alone!). 
\par Even if online advertising were to be restored to its erstwhile glory days, other bottlenecks remain. Advertising enco
urages the consumer to interact and to initiate the delivery of a product to him. This - the delivery phase - is a slow and enervating epilogue to the exciting affair of orderingonline. Too many consumers still complain of late delivery of the wrong ordef
ective products. 
\par The solution may lie in the integration of advertising and content. The late Pointcast, for instance, integrated advertising into its news broadcasts, continuously streamed to the user's screen, even when inactive (it had an active screen 
saver and ticker in a "push technology"). Downloading ofdigital music, video and text (e-books) leads to the immediate gratificationof consumers and increases the efficacy of advertising. 
\par Whatever the case may be, a uniform, agreed upon system of rating as a basis for charging advertisers, is sorely needed. There is also the question of what does the advertiser pay for?\~
 The rates of many advertisers (Procter and Gamble, for instance) are based not on the number of hits or impressions (=entries, visits to a site). - but on the number of the times that their advertisement was hit (page views), or clicked through. \line . 
\line Finally, there is the paid subscription model - a flop to judge by the experience of the meagre number of sites of venerable and leading newspapers that are on a subscription basis. Dow Jones (Wall Street Journal) and TheEconomist. Only two. 
\par All this is not very promising. But one should never forget that the Internet is probably the closest thing we have to an efficient market. As consumers ref
use to pay for content, investment will dry up and content will become scarce (through closures of web sites). As scarcity sets in, consumermay reconsider. 
\par Your article deals with the future of the Internet as a medium. Will it be able to support its content creation and distribution operations economically? 
\par If the Internet is a budding medium - then we should derive great benefit from a study of the history of its predecessors. 
\par }{\cs15\b\f1 The Future History of the Internet a a Medium}{\f1  }{\f1\fs20 
\par The internet is simply the latest in a series of networks which revolutionized our lives. A century before the internet, the telegraph, the railways, the radio and the telephone have been similarly heralded as "global" and transforming.\~
 Every medium of communications goes through the same evolutionary cycle: 
\par }{\cs15\b\f1 Anarchy }{\f1\fs20 
\par }{\cs15\b\f1 The Public Phase }{\f1\fs20 
\par At this stage, the medium and the resources attached to
 it are very cheap, accessible, under no regulatory constraints. The public sector steps in : higher educationinstitutions, religious institutions, government, not for profit organizations, non governmental organizations (NGOs), trade unions, etc. Bedevil
ed by limited financialresources, they regard the new medium as a cost effective way of disseminating their messages. 
\par The Internet was not exempt from this phase which ended only a few years ago. It started with a complete computer anarchy manifested in ad
 hoc networks, localnetworks, networks of organizations (mainly universities and organs of the government such as DARPA, a part of the defence establishment, in the USA). Non commercial entities jumped on the bandwagon and started sewing these networks to
g
ether (an activity fully subsidized by government funds). Theresult was a globe encompassing network of academic institutions. The American Pentagon established the network of all networks, the ARPANET. Other government departments joined the fray, headed
 by the National ScienceFoundation (NSF) which withdrew only lately from the Internet. 
\par The Internet (with a different name) became semi-public property - with access granted to the chosen few. 
\par Radio took precisely this course. Radio transmissions started 
in the USA in 1920. Those were anarchic broadcasts with no discernible regularity. Non commercialorganizations and not for profit organizations began their own broadcasts and even created radio broadcasting infrastructure (albeit of the cheap andlocal kin
d)dedicated to their audiences. Trade unions, certain educational institutionsand religious groups commenced "public radio" broadcasts. 
\par }{\cs15\b\f1 The Commercial Phase }{\f1\fs20 
\par When the users (e.g., listeners in the case of the radio, or owners of PCs and modems in the case 
of the Internet) reach a critical mass - the business sector isalerted. In the name of capitalist ideology (another religion, really) itdemands "privatization" of the medium. This harps on very sensitive stringsin every Western soul: the efficient allocat
i
on of resources which is the result of competition. Corruption and inefficiency are intuitively associated with the public sector ("Other People's Money" - OPM). This, together with the ulterior motives of members of the ruling political echelons (the inf
amous American Paranoia), a lack of variety and of cateringto the tastes and interests of certain audiences and the automatic equationof private enterprise with democracy lead to a privatization of the youngmedium. 
\par The end result is the same: the private s
ector takes over the medium from "below" (makes offers to the owners or operators of the medium that they cannotpossibly refuse) - or from "above" (successful lobbying in the corridors of power leads to the appropriate legislation and the medium is "priva
t
ized"). Every privatization - especially that of a medium - provokes public opposition. There are (usually founded) suspicions that the interests of the public are compromised and sacrificed on the altar of commercialization and rating. Fears of monopoliz
a
tion and cartelization of the medium are evoked - and proven correct in due course. Otherwise, there is fear of the concentration of control of the medium in a few hands. All these things do happen - butthe pace is so slow that the initial fears are forgo
tten and publicattention reverts to fresher issues. 
\par A new Communications Act was enacted in the USA in 1934. It was meant to transform radio frequencies into a national resource to be sold to the private sectorwhich was supposed to use it to transmit radio
 signals to receivers. In other words : the radio was passed on to private and commercial hands. Public radio was doomed to be marginalized. 
\par The American administration withdrew from its last major involvement in the Internet in April 1995, when the NSF ceased to finance some of the networks and,thus, privatized its hitherto heavy involvement in the net. 
\par A new Communications Act was legislated
 in 1996. It permitted "organized anarchy". It allowed media operators to invade each other's territories. Phone companies were allowed to transmit video and cable companies were allowed to transmit telephony, for instance. This was all phased over a long
p
eriod of time - still, it was a revolution whose magnitude is difficult to gauge and whose consequences defy imagination. It carries an equally momentous price tag - official censorship. "Voluntary censorship", to be sure, somewhat toothless standardizati
o
n and enforcement authorities, to be sure - still, a censorship with its own institutions to boot. The private sector reacted by threatening litigation - but, beneath the surface it is caving in to pressure and temptation, constructing its own censorship 
codes both in the cable and in the internet media. 
\par }{\cs15\b\f1 Institutionalization}{\f1  }{\f1\fs20 
\par This phase is the next in the Internet's history, though, it seems, few realize it. 
\par It is characterized by enhanced activities of legislation. Legislators, on all levels, discover th
e medium and lurch at it passionately. Resources which were considered"free", suddenly are transformed to "national treasures not to be dispensedwith cheaply, casually and with frivolity". 
\par It is conceivable that certain parts of the Internet will be "nationalized" (for instance, in the form of a licensing requirement) and tendered to the private sector. Legislation will be enacted which will deal with permitted and disallowed \line 
content (obscenity ? incitement ? racial or gender bias ?) No medium in the USA 
(not to mention the wide world) has eschewed such legislation. There are sure to be demands to allocate time (or space, or software, orcontent, or hardware) to "minorities", to "public affairs", to "communitybusiness". This is a tax that the business sect
or will have to pay to fendoff the eager legislator and his nuisance value. 
\par All this is bound to lead to a monopolization of hosts and servers. The important broadcast channels will diminish in number and be subjected to severe contentrestrictions. Sites w
hich will refuse to succumb to these requirements - will be deleted or neutralized. Content guidelines (euphemism for censorship) exist, even as we write, in all major content providers (CompuServe, AOL, Yahoo!-Geocities, Tripod, Prodigy). 
\par \page 
\par }{\cs15\b\f1 The Bloodbath }{\f1\fs20 
\par This is the phase of consolidation. The number of players is severely reduced. The number of browser types will settle on 2-3 (Netscape, Microsoft and Opera?). Networks will merge to form privately owned mega-networks. Servers will merge to form hyper-se
rvers run on supercomputers in "serverfarms". The number of ISPs will be considerably cut.\~ 50 companies ruled the greater part of the media markets in the USA in 1983. The number in 1995 was 18. Atthe end of the century they will number 6. 
\par This is the st
age when companies - fighting for financial survival - strive to acquire as many users/listeners/viewers as possible. The programming is shallowed to thelowest (and widest) common denominator. Shallow programming dominates aslong as the bloodbath proceeds
. 
\par }{\cs15\b\f1 From Rags to Riches }{\f1\fs20 
\par Tough competition produces four processes: 
\par \~\~\~\~ 1. A Major Drop in Hardware Prices 
\par This happens in every medium but it doubly applies to a computer-dependent medium, such as the Internet. \line Computer technology seems to abide by "Moo
re's Law" which says that the number of transistors which can be put on a chip doubles every 18 months. As a result of this miniaturization, computing power quadruples every 18 months and an exponential series ensues. Organic-biological-DNA computers, qua
ntumcomputers, chaos computers - prompted by vast profits and spawned by inventive genius will ensure the continued applicability of Moore's Law. 
\par The Internet is also subject to "Metcalf's Law". 
\par It says that when we connect N computers to a network - we g
et an increase of N to the second power in its computing processing power. And these N computers are more powerful every year, according to Moore's Law. The growth of computing powers in networks is a multiple of the effects ofthe two laws. More and more 
computers with ever increasing computing powergetconnected and create an exponential 16 times growth in the network's computing power every 18 months. 
\par \~\~\~\~ 2. Content related Fees 
\par This was prevalent in the Net until recently. Even potentially commercial s
oftware can still be downloaded for free. In many countries television viewers still pay for television broadcasts - but in the USA and many other countries in the West, the basic package of television channels comes freeof charge. 
\par As users / consumers fo
rm a habit of using (or consuming) the software - it is commercialized and begins to carry a price tag. This is what happened with the advent of cable television : contents are sold for subscription or per usage (Pay Per View - PPV) fees. 
\par Gradually, this 
is what will happen to most of the sites and software on the Net. Those which survive will begin to collect usage fees, access fees, subscription fees, downloading fees and other, appropriately named, fees. These fees are bound to be low - but it is the p
rinciple that counts. Even a few cents per transaction may accumulate to hefty sums with the traffic which characterizes some web sites on the Net (or, at least its more popular locales). 
\par \page 
\par \~\~\~\~ 3. Increased User Friendliness 
\par As long as the computer is less user friendly and less reliable (predictable) than television - less of a black box - its potential (and its future) is limited. Televisionattracts 3.5 billion users daily. The Internet stands to attract - under the \line 
most exuberant scenario - less than 
one tenth of this number of people. The only reasons for this disparity are (the lack of) user friendliness and reliability. Even browsers, among the most user friendly applications ever -are not sufficiently so. The user still needs to know how to use a 
keyboardand must possess some basic acquaintance with the operating system.\~
 Themore mature the medium, the more friendly it becomes. Finally, it will be operated using speech or common language. There will be room left for user"hunches" and built in flexible responses. 
\par \~\~\~\~ 4. Social Taxes 
\par Sooner or later, the business sector has to mollify the God of public opinion with offerings of political and social nature. The Internet is an affluent, educated, yuppie medium. It requires literacy and numeracy, live interest in information and \line 
its various uses (scientific, commercial, other), a lot of resources (free time, money to invest in hardware, software and connect time). It empowers - andthus deepens the divide between the haves and have-nots, the developed a
ndthe developing world, the knowing and the ignorant, the computer illiterate. 
\par In short: the Internet is an elitist medium. Publicly, this is an unhealthy posture. "Internetophobia" is already discernible. People (and politicians) talk about how unsafe th
e Internet is and about its possible uses forracial, sexist and pornographic purposes. The wider public is in a state ofawe. 
\par So, site builders and owners will do well to begin to improve their image: provide free access to schools and community centres, b
ankroll internet literacy classes, freely distribute contents and software to educational institutions, collaborate with researchers and social scientists and engineers. In short: encourage the view that the Internet is a medium catering to the needs ofth
e
 community and the underprivileged, a mostly altruist endeavour. This also happens to make good business sense by educating and conditioning afuture generation of users. He who visited a site when a student, free of charge - will pay to do so when made an
 
executive. Such a user will also pass on the information within andwithout his organization. This is called media exposure. The future will, nodoubt, will be witness to public Internet terminals, subsidized ISP accounts, free Internet classes and an alter
native "non-commercial, public"approach to the Net. This may prove to be one more source of revenue to content creatorsand distributors.\~\line \~

OverDrive - an e-commerce, software conversion and e-publishing applications leader - has just expanded an e-book technology centre by adding 200 e-book editors. This happened in Montego Bay, Jamaica - one of the less privileged spots on earth. The centre
 
now provides a vertical e-publishing service - from manuscript editing to conversion to Quark (for POD), Adobe, and MS Reader ebook formats. Thus, it is not confined to the classic sweatshop cum production centre so common in Less Developed Countries (LDC
's). It is a full fledged operation with access to cutting edge technology. 
\par The Jamaican OverDrive is the harbinger of things to come and the outcome of a confluence of a few trends. 
\par First, there is the insatiable appetite big publishers (such as McGraw-H
ill, Random House, and Harper Collins) have developed to converting their hitherto inertial backlists into e-books. Gone are the days when e-books were perceived as merely a novel form of packaging. Publishers understood the cash potential this new distri
bution channel offers and the value added to stale print tomes in the conversion process. This epiphany is especially manifest in education and textbook publishing. 
\par Then there is the maturation of industry standards, readers and audiences. Both the supply 
side (title lists) and the demand side (readership) have increased. Giants like Microsoft have successfully entered the fray with new e-book reader applications, clearer fonts, and massive marketing. Retailers - such as Barnes and Noble - opened their gat
es to e-books. A host of independent publishers make good use of the negligible-cost distribution channel that the Internet is. Competition and positioning are already fierce - a good sign. 
\par The Internet used to be an English, affluent middle-class, white c
ollar, male phenomenon. It has long lost these attributes. The digital divides that opened up with the early adoption of the Net by academe and business - are narrowing. Already there are more women than men users and English is the language of less than 
half of all web sites. The wireless Net will grant developing countries the chance to catch up. 
\par Astute entrepreneurs are bound to take advantage of the business-friendly profile of the manpower and investment-hungry governments of some developing countries
. It is not uncommon to find a mastery of English, a college degree in the sciences, readiness to work outlandish hours at a fraction of wages in Germany or the USA - all combined in one employee in these deprived countries. India has sprouted a whole ind
ustry based on these competitive endowments. 
\par Here is how Steve Potash, OverDrive's CEO, explains his daring move in OverDrive's press release dated May 22, 2001: 
\par "Everyone we are partnering with in the US and worldwide has been very excited and delighted 
by the tremendous success and quality of eBook production from OverDrive Jamaica. Jamaica has tremendous untapped talent in its young people. Jamaica is the largest English-speaking nation in the Caribbean and their educational and technical programs prov
i
de us with a wealth of quality candidates for careers in electronic publishing. We could not have had this success without the support and responsiveness of the Jamaican government and its agencies. At every stage the agencies assisted us in opening our t
e
chnology centre and staffing it with trained and competent eBook professionals. OverDrive Jamaica will be pioneering many of the advances for extending books, reference materials, textbooks, literature and journals into new digital channels - and will sho
rtly become the foremost centre for eBook automation serving both US and international markets". 
\par Druanne Martin, OverDrive's Director of publishing services elaborates: 
\par ""With Jamaica and Cleveland, Ohio sharing the same time zone (EST), we have our US an
d Jamaican production teams in sync. Jamaica provides a beautiful and warm climate, literally, for us to build long-term partnerships and to invite our publishing and content clients to come and visit their books in production". 
\par The Jamaican Minister of Industry, Commerce and Technology, the Hon. Phillip Paulwell reciprocates: 
\par "We are proud that OverDrive has selected Jamaica to extend its leadership in eBook technology. OverDrive is benefiting from the investments Jamaica has made in developing the neede
d infrastructure for IT companies to locate and build skilled workforces here." 
\par There is nothing new in outsourcing back office work (insurance claims processing, air ticket reservations, medical records maintenance) to third world countries, such as (the
 notable example) India. Research and Development is routinely farmed out to aspiring first world countries such as Israel and Ireland. But OverDrive's Jamaican facility is an example of something more sophisticated and more durable. Western firms are dis
c
overing the immense pools of skills, talent, innovation, and top notch scientific and other education often offered even by the poorest of nations. These multinationals entrust the locals now with more than keyboarding and responding to customer queries u
s
ing fake names. The Jamaican venture is a business partnership. In a way, it is a topsy-turvy world. Digital animation is produced in India and consumed in the States. The low compensation of scientists attracts the technology and R&D arms of the likes of
 General Electric to Asia and Intel to Israel. In other words, there are budding signs of a reversing brain drain - from West to East. 
\par E-publishing is at the forefront of software engineering, e-consumerism, intellectual property technologies, payment syst
ems, conversion applications, the mobile Internet, and, basically, every important trend in network and computing and digital content. Its migration to warmer and cheaper climates may be inevitable. OverDrive sounds happy enough.

\par The Internet is too rich. Even powerful and sophisticated search engines, such as Google, return a lot of trash, dead ends, and Error 404's in response to the most
 well-defined query, Boolean operators and all. Directories created by human editors - such as Yahoo! or the Open Directory Project - are often overwhelmed by the amount of material out there. Like the legendary blob, the Internet is clearly out of classi
f
icatory control. Some web sites - like Suite101 - have introduced the old and tried Dewey subject classification system successfully used in non-virtual libraries for more than a century. Books - both print and electronic - (actually, their publishers) ge
t
 assigned an ISBN (International Standard Book Number) by national agencies. Periodical publications (magazines, newsletters, bulletins) sport an ISSN (International Serial Standard Number). National libraries dole out CIP's (Cataloguing in Publication nu
m
bers), which help lesser outfits to catalogue the book upon arrival. But the emergence of new book formats, independent publishing, and self publishing has strained this already creaking system to its limits. In short: the whole thing is fast developing i
nto an awful mess. 
\par Resolution is one solution. 
\par Resolution is the linking of identifiers to content. An identifier can be a word, or a phrase. RealNames implemented this approach and its proprietary software is now incorporated in most browsers. The user t
ypes a word, brand name, phrase, or code, and gets re-directed to a web site with the appropriate content. The only snag: RealNames identifiers are for sale. Thus, its identifiers are not guaranteed to lead to the best, only, or relevant resource. Similar
 systems are available in many languages. Nexet, for example, provides such a resolution service in Hebrew. 
\par The Association of American Publishers (APA) has an Enabling Technologies Committee. Fittingly, at the Frankfurt Book Fair of 1997, it announced the
 DOI (Digital Object Identifier) initiative. An International DOI Foundation (IDF) was set up and invited all publishers - American and non-American alike - to apply for a unique DOI prefix. DOI is actually a private case of a larger system of "handles" d
e
veloped by the CNRI (Corporation for National Research Initiatives). Their "Handle Resolver" is a browser plug-in software, which re-directs their handles to URL's or other pieces of data, or content. Without the Resolver, typing in the handle simply dire
cts the user to a few proxy servers, which "understand" the handle protocols. 
\par The interesting (and new) feature of the system is its ability to resolve to MULTIPLE locations (URL's, or data, or content). The same identifier can resolve to a Universe of int
er-related information (effectively, to a mini-library). The content thus resolved need not be limited to text. Multiple resolution works with audio, images, and even video. 
\par The IDF's press release is worth some extensive quoting: 
\par "Imagine you're the manager of an Internet company reading a story online in the "Wall Street Journal" written by Stacey E. Bressler, a co-author of Communities of Commerce, and at the end of the story there is a link to purchase options for the book. 
\line Now imagine you are an online retailer, a syndicator or a reporter for an online news service and you are reading a review in "Publishers Weekly" about Communities of Commerce and you run across a link to related resources. \line 
And imagine you are in Buenos Aires, and in an online publication you encounter a link to "D-Lib Magazine", an electronic journal produced in Washington, D.C. which offers you locale-specific choices for downloading an article. \line 
The above examples demonstrate how multiple resolution can present you with a list o
f links from within an electronic document or page. The links beneath the labels - URLs and email addresses - would all be stored in the DOI System, and multiple resolution means any or all of those links can be displayed for you to select from in one men
u. Any combination of links to related resources can be included in these menus. \line 
Capable of providing much richer experiences then single resolution to a URL, Multiple Resolution operates on the premise that content, not its location, is identified. In oth
er words, where content and related resources reside is secondary information. Multiple Resolution enables content owners and distributors to identify their intellectual property with bound collections of related resources at a hyperlink's point of depart
ure, instead of requiring a user to leave the page to go to a new location for further information. \line 
A content owner controls and manages all the related resources in each of these menus and can determine which information is accessible to each business par
tner within the supply chain. When an administrator changes any facet of this information, the change is simultaneous on all internal networks and the Internet. A DOI is a permanent identifier, analogous to a telephone number for life, so tomorrow and yea
rs from now a user can locate the product and related resources wherever they may have been moved or archived to." 
\par The IDF provides a limited, text-only, online demonstration. When sweeping with the cursor over a linked item, a pop-down menu of options is 
presented. These options are pre-defined and customized by the content creators and owners. In the first example above (book purchase options) the DOI resolves to retail outlets (categorized by book formats), information about the title and the author, di
g
ital rights management information (permissions), and more. The DOI server generates this information in "real time", "on the fly". But it is the author, or (more often) the publisher that choose the information, its modes of presentation, selections, and
 marketing and sales data. The ingenuity is in the fact that the DOI server's files and records can be updated, replaced, or deleted. It does not affect the resolution path - only the content resolved to.

\par }{\f1\fs20 The circulation of print magazines has declined precipitously in the last 24 months. This dissolution of subscriber bases has accelerated dramatic
ally as economic recession set in. But a diminishing wealth effect is only partly to blame. The managements of printed periodicals - from dailies to quarterlies - failed miserably to grasp the Internet's potential and\~
 potential threat. They were fooled by
 the lack of convenient and cheap e-reading devices into believing that old habits die hard. They do - but magazine reading is not habit forming. Readers' loyalties are fickle and shift according to content and price. The Web offers cornucopial and niche-
targeted content - free of charge or very cheaply. This is hard to beat and is getting harder by the day as natural selection among dot.bombs spares only quality content providers.\~ }{\f1\fs27 
\par }{\f1\fs20 Consider Ploughshares, the Literary Journal. }{\f1\fs27 
\par }{\f1\fs20 It is a venerable, not for p
rofit, print journal published by Emerson College, now marking its 30th anniversary. It recently inaugurated its web sibling. The project consumed three years and $125,000 (grant from the Wallace-Reader's Digest Funds). Every title Ploughshares has ever p
ublished was indexed (over 18,000 journal pages digitized). In all, the "website will offer free access to over 2,750 poems and short stories from past and current issues." }{\f1\fs27 
\par }{\f1\fs20 
The more than 2000 (!) authors ever published in Ploughshares will each maintain a personal web page comprising biographical notes, press releases, new books and events announcements and links to other web sites. This is the Yahoo! formula. Content genera
ted by the authors will thus transform Ploughshares into a leading literary portal.\line \line 
But Ploughshares did not stop at this standard features. A "bookshelf" will link to book reviews contributed online (and augmented by the magazine's own prestigious offerin
gs). An annotated bookstore is just a step away (though Ploughshares' web site does not include one hitherto). The next best thing is a rights-management application used by\~
 the journal's authors to grant online publishing permissions for their work to third parties.\line \line No print literary magazine can beat this one stop shop. So, how can print publications defend themselves? }{\f1\fs27 
\par }{\f1\fs20 By being creative and by not conceding defeat is how. }{\f1\fs27 
\par }{\f1\fs20 Consider WuliWeb's example of thinking outside the printed box. }{\f1\fs27 
\par }{\f1\fs20 It is a simple 
online application which enables its users to "send, save and share material from print publications". Participating magazines and newspapers print "WuliCodes" on their (physical) pages and WuliWeb subscribers barcode-scan, or manually enter them into the
ir online "Content Manager" via keyboard, PDA, pager, cell phone, or fixed phone (using a PIN). The service is free (paid for by the magazine publishers and advertisers) and, according to WuliWeb, offers these advantages to its users: }{\f1\fs27 
\par }{\f1\fs20 "Once you choose to u
se WuliWeb's free service, you will no longer have to laboriously "tear and share" print articles or ads that you want to archive or share with colleagues or friends. You will be able to store material sourced from print publications permanently in your o
w
n secure, electronic files, and you can share this material instantly with any number of people. Magazine and Newspaper Publishers will now have the ability to distribute their online content more widely and to offer a richer experience to their readers. 
Advertisers will be able to deploy dynamic and media-rich content to\line attract and convert customers, and will be able to communicate more completely with their customers." }{\f1\fs27 
\par }{\f1\fs20 Links to the shared material are stored in WuliWeb's central database and users gain 
access to them by signing up for a (free) WuliWeb account. Thus, the user's mailbox is unencumbered by huge downloads. Moreover, WuliWeb allows for a keywords-based search of articles saved.\~ }{\f1\fs27 
\par }{\f1\fs20 Perhaps the only serious drawback is that WuliWeb provides its 
users only with LINKS to content stored on publishers' web sites. It is a directory service - not a full text database. This creates dependence. Links may get broken. Whole web sites vanish. Magazines and their publishers go under. All the more reason for
 publishers to adopt this service and make it their own.}{\f1\fs27

n knowledge - the libraries - failed so spectacularly to ride the tiger of the Internet, that epitome and apex of knowledge creation and distribution. At first, libraries, the inertial repositories of printed matter, were overwhelmed by the rapid pace of 
t
echnology and by the ephemeral and anarchic content it spawned. They were reduced to providing access to dull card catalogues and unimaginative collections of web links. The more daring added online exhibits and digitized collections. A typical library we
b site is still comprised of static representations of the library's physical assets and a few quasi-interactive services.\~ }{\f1\fs27 
\par }{\f1\fs20 This tendency - by both publishers and libraries - to inadequately and inappropriately pour old wine into new vessels is what caused the recent furor over e-books.\~\line \line 
The lending of e-books to patrons appears to be a natural extension of the classical role of libraries: physical book lending. Libraries sought also to extend their archival functions to e-books. But librarians failed to g
rasp the essential and substantive differences between the two formats. E-books can be easily, stealthily, and cheaply copied, for instance. Copyright violations are a real and present danger with e-books. Moreover, e-books are not a tangible product. "Le
n
ding" an e-book - is tantamount to copying an e-book. In other words, e-books are not books at all. They are software products. Libraries have pioneered digital collections (as they have other information technologies throughout history) and are still the
 main promoters of e-publishing. But now they are at risk of becoming piracy portals.\~ }{\f1\fs27 
\par }{\f1\fs20 Solutions are, appropriately, being borrowed from the software industry. NetLibrary has lately granted multiple user licences to a university library system. Such licenc
es allow for unlimited access and are priced according to the number of the library's patrons, or the number of its reading devices and terminals. Another possibility is to implement the shareware model - a trial period followed by a purchase option or an
 expiration, a-la Rosetta's expiring e-book.\~\line \line Distributor Baker & Taylor have unveiled at the recent ALA a prototype e-book distribution system jointly developed\~
 by ibooks and Digital Owl. It will be sold to libraries by B&T's Informata division and Reciprocal.\line \line 
The annual subscription for use of the digital library comprises "a catalog of digital content, brandable pages and web based tools for each participating library to customize for their patrons. Patrons of participating libraries will then be able 
to browse digital content online, or download and check out the content they are most interested in. Content may be checked out for an extended period of time set by each library, including checking out eBooks from home." Still, it seems that B&T's approa
ch is heavily influenced by software licencing ("one copy one use").\line \line 
But, there is an underlying, fundamental incompatibility between the Internet and the library. They are competitors. One vitiates the other. Free Internet access and e-book reading device
s in libraries notwithstanding - the Internet, unless harnessed and integrated by libraries, threatens their very existence by depriving them of patrons. Libraries, in turn, threaten the budding software industry we, misleadingly, call "e-publishing".\~ }

 create knowledge and disseminate it.}{\f1\fs27

\par }{\f1\fs20 UNESCO's arbitrary and ungrounded definition of "book" is: }{\f1\fs27 
\par }{\f1\fs20 ""Non-periodical printed publication of at least 49 pages excluding covers". }{\f1\fs27 
\par }{\f1\fs20 But a book, above all else, is a medium. It encapsulates informa
tion (of one kind or another) and conveys it across time and space. Moreover, as opposed to common opinion, it is - and has always been - a rigidly formal affair. Even the latest "innovations" are nothing but ancient wine in sparkling new bottles. }{
\f1\fs27 
\par }{\f1\fs20 Conside
r the scrolling protocol. Our eyes and brains are limited readers-decoders. There is only that much that the eye can encompass and the brain interpret. Hence the need to segment data into cognitively digestible chunks. There are two forms of scrolling - l
a
teral and vertical. The papyrus, the broadsheet newspaper, and the computer screen are three examples of the vertical scroll - from top to bottom or vice versa. The e-book, the microfilm, the vellum, and the print book are instances of the lateral scroll 
- from left to right (or from right to left, in the Semitic languages).\~ }{\f1\fs27 
\par }{\f1\fs20 In many respects, audio books are much more revolutionary than e-books. They do not employ visual symbols (all other types of books do), or a straightforward scrolling method. E-books
, on the other hand, are a throwback to the days of the papyrus.\~
 The text cannot be opened at any point in a series of connected pages and the content is carried only on one side of the (electronic) "leaf". Parchment, by comparison, was multi-paged, easil
y browseable, and printed on both sides of the leaf. It led to a revolution in publishing and to the print book. All these advances are now being reversed by the e-book. Luckily, the e-book retains one innovation of the parchment - the hypertext. Early Je
w
ish and Christian texts (as well as Roman legal scholarship) was written on parchment (and later printed) and included numerous inter-textual links. The Talmud, for example, is made of a main text (the Mishna) which hyperlinks on the same page to numerous
 interpretations (exegesis) offered by scholars throughout generations of Jewish learning.\~\~ }{\f1\fs27 
\par }{\f1\fs20 Another distinguishing feature of books is portability (or mobility). Books on papyrus, vellum, paper, or PDA - are all transportable. In other words, the replicat
ion of the book's message is achieved by passing it along and no loss is incurred thereby (i.e., there is no physical metamorphosis of the message). The book is like a perpetuum mobile. It spreads its content virally by being circulated and is not diminis
hed or altered by it. Physically, it is eroded, of course - but it can be copied faithfully. It is permanent.\~ }{\f1\fs27 
\par }{\f1\fs20 Not so the e-book or the CD-ROM. Both are dependent on devices (readers or drives, respectively). Both are technology-specific and format-specifi
c. Changes in technology - both in hardware and in software - are liable to render many e-books unreadable. And portability is hampered by battery life, lighting conditions, or the availability of appropriate infrastructure (e.g., of electricity).\~ }{
\f1\fs27 
\par }{\b\f1\fs20 II. The Constant Content Revolution}{\f1\fs20  }{\f1\fs27 
\par }{\f1\fs20 Every generation applies the same age-old principles to new "content-containers". Every such transmutation yields a great surge in the creation of content and its dissemination. The incunabula (the first printed books) made k
nowledge accessible (sometimes in the vernacular) to scholars and laymen alike and liberated books from the scriptoria and "libraries" of monasteries. The printing press technology shattered the content monopoly. In 50 years (1450-1500), the number of boo
ks in Europe surged from a few thousand to more than 9 million! And, as McLuhan has noted, it shifted the emphasis from the oral mode of content distribution (i.e., "communication") to the visual mode. }{\f1\fs27 
\par }{\f1\fs20 E-books are threatening to do the same. "Book ATMs" wi
ll provide Print on Demand (POD) services to faraway places. People in remote corners of the earth will be able to select from publishing backlists and front lists comprising millions of titles. Millions of authors are now able to realize their dream to h
a
ve their work published cheaply and without editorial barriers to entry. The e-book is the Internet's prodigal son. The latter is the ideal distribution channel of the former. The monopoly of the big publishing houses on everything written - from romance 
t
o scholarly journals - is a thing of the past. In a way, it is ironic. Publishing, in its earliest forms, was a revolt against the writing (letters) monopoly of the priestly classes. It flourished in non-theocratic societies such as Rome, or China - and l
anguished where religion reigned (such as in Sumeria, Egypt, the Islamic world, and Medieval Europe). }{\f1\fs27 
\par }{\f1\fs20 With e-books, content will once more become a collaborative effort, as it has been well into the Middle Ages. Authors and audience used to interact (remem
ber Socrates) to generate knowledge, information, and narratives. Interactive e-books, multimedia, discussion lists, and collective authorship efforts restore this great tradition. Moreover, as in the not so distant past, authors are yet again the publish
e
rs and sellers of their work. The distinctions between these functions is very recent. E-books and POD partially help to restore the pre-modern state of affairs. Up until the 20th century, some books first appeared as a series of pamphlets (often publishe
d
 in daily papers or magazines) or were sold by subscription. Serialized e-books resort to these erstwhile marketing ploys. E-books may also help restore the balance between best-sellers and midlist authors and between fiction and textbooks. E-books are be
st suited to cater to niche markets, hitherto neglected by all major publishers. 
\par \page }{\f1\fs27 
\par }{\b\f1\fs20 III. Literature for the Millions}{\f1\fs20  }{\f1\fs27 
\par }{\f1\fs20 E-books are the quintessential "literature for the millions". They are cheaper than even paperbacks. John Bell (competing with Dr. Johnson)
 published "The Poets of Great Britain" in 1777-83. Each of the 109 volumes cost six shillings (compared to the usual guinea or more). The Railway Library of novels (1,300 volumes) costs 1 shilling apiece only eight decades later. The price continued to d
ive throughout the next century and a half. E-books and POD are likely to do unto paperbacks what these reprints did to originals. Some reprint libraries specialized in public domain works, very much like the bulk of e-book offering nowadays. }{\f1\fs27 

\par }{\f1\fs20 The plunge in
 book prices, the lowering of barriers to entry due to new technologies and plentiful credit, the proliferation of publishers, and the cutthroat competition among booksellers was such that price regulation (cartel) had to be introduced. Net publisher pric
e
s, trade discounts, list prices were all anti-competitive inventions of the 19th century, mainly in Europe. They were accompanied by the rise of trade associations, publishers organizations, literary agents, author contracts, royalties agreements, mass ma
rketing, and standardized copyrights.\~ }{\f1\fs27 
\par }{\f1\fs20 The sale of print books over the Internet can be conceptualized as the continuation of mail order catalogues by virtual means. But e-books are different. They are detrimental to all these cosy arrangements. Legally, a
n e-book may not be considered to constitute a "book" at all. Existing contracts between authors and publishers may not cover e-books. The serious price competition they offer to more traditional forms of publishing may end up pushing the whole industry t
o
 re-define itself. Rights may have to be re-assigned, revenues re-distributed, contractual relationships re-thought. Moreover, e-books have hitherto been to print books what paperbacks are to hardcovers - re-formatted renditions. But more and more authors
 are publishing their books primarily or exclusively as e-books. E-books thus threaten hardcovers and paperbacks alike. They are not merely a new format. They are a new mode of publishing. }{\f1\fs27 
\par }{\f1\fs20 Every technological innovation was bitterly resisted by Luddite pri
nters and publishers: stereotyping, the iron press, the application of steam power, mechanical typecasting and typesetting, new methods of reproducing illustrations, cloth bindings, machine-made paper, ready-bound books, paperbacks, book clubs, and book t
o
kens. Without exception, they relented and adopted the new technologies to their considerable commercial advantage. It is no surprise, therefore, that publishers were hesitant to adopt the Internet, POD, and e-publishing technologies. The surprise lies in
 the relative haste with which they came to adopt it, egged on by authors and booksellers. }{\f1\fs27 
\par }{\b\f1\fs20 IV. Intellectual Pirates and Intellectual Property}{\f1\fs20  }{\f1\fs27 
\par }{\f1\fs20 Despite the technological breakthroughs that coalesced to form the modern printing press - printed books in the 1
7th and 18th centuries were derided by their contemporaries as inferior to their laboriously hand-made antecedents and to the incunabula. One is reminded of the current complaints about the new media (Internet, e-books), its shoddy workmanship, shabby app
e
arance, and the rampant piracy. The first decades following the invention of the printing press, were, as the Encyclopedia Britannica puts it "a restless, highly competitive free for all ... (with) enormous vitality and variety (often leading to) careless
 work".\~ }{\f1\fs27 
\par }{\f1\fs20 
There were egregious acts of piracy - for instance, the illicit copying of the Aldine Latin "pocket books", or the all-pervasive piracy in England in the 17th century (a direct result of over-regulation and coercive copyright monopolies). Shakespe
are's work was published by notorious pirates and infringers of emerging intellectual property rights. Later, the American colonies became the world's centre of industrialized and systematic book piracy. Confronted with abundant and cheap pirated foreign 
books, local authors resorted to freelancing in magazines and lecture tours in a vain effort to make ends meet. }{\f1\fs27 
\par }{\f1\fs20 Pirates and unlicenced - and, therefore, subversive - publishers were prosecuted under a variety of monopoly and libel laws (and, later, under n
ational security and obscenity laws). There was little or no difference between royal and "democratic" governments. They all acted ruthlessly to preserve their control of publishing. John Milton wrote his passionate plea against censorship, Areopagitica, 
i
n response to the 1643 licencing ordinance passed by Parliament. The revolutionary Copyright Act of 1709 in England established the rights of authors and publishers to reap the commercial fruits of their endeavours exclusively, though only for a prescribe
d period of time. }{\f1\fs27 
\par }{\b\f1\fs20 V. As Readership Expanded}{\f1\fs20  }{\f1\fs27 
\par }{\f1\fs20 The battle between industrial-commercial publishers (fortified by ever more potent technologies) and the arts and craftsmanship crowd never ceased and it is raging now as fiercely as ever in numerous discussion 
lists, fora, tomes, and conferences. William Morris started the "private press" movement in England in the 19th century to counter what he regarded as the callous commercialization of book publishing. When the printing press was invented, it was put to co
m
mercial use by private entrepreneurs (traders) of the day. Established "publishers" (monasteries), with a few exceptions (e.g., in Augsburg, Germany and in Subiaco, Italy) shunned it and regarded it as a major threat to culture and civilization. Their att
acks on printing read like the litanies against self-publishing or corporate-controlled publishing today.\~ }{\f1\fs27 
\par }{\f1\fs20 But, as readership expanded (women and the poor became increasingly literate), market forces reacted. The number of publishers multiplied relentlessl
y. At the beginning of the 19th century, innovative lithographic and offset processes allowed publishers in the West to add illustrations (at first, black and white and then in color), tables, detailed maps and anatomical charts, and other graphics to the
i
r books. Battles fought between publishers-librarians over formats (book sizes) and fonts (Gothic versus Roman) were ultimately decided by consumer preferences. Multimedia was born. The e-book will, probably, undergo a similar transition from being the st
atic digital rendition of a print edition - to being a lively, colorful, interactive and commercially enabled creature.\~ }{\f1\fs27 
\par }{\f1\fs20 The commercial lending library and, later, the free library were two additional reactions to increasing demand. As early as the 18th ce
ntury, publishers and booksellers expressed the fear that libraries will cannibalize their trade. Two centuries of accumulated experience demonstrate that the opposite has happened. Libraries have enhanced book sales and have become a major market in thei
r own right. }{\f1\fs27 
\par }{\b\f1\fs20 VI. The State of Subversion}{\f1\fs20  }{\f1\fs27 
\par }{\f1\fs20 Publishing has always been a social pursuit and depended heavily on social developments, such as the spread of literacy and the liberation of minorities (especially, of women).\~
As every new format matures, it is subjected to regulation from within and from without. E-books (and, by extension, digital content on the Web) will be no exception. Hence the recurrent and current attempts at regulation.\~ }{\f1\fs27 
\par }{\f1\fs20 Every new variant of content pa
ckaging was labeled as "dangerous" at its inception. The Church (formerly the largest publisher of bibles and other religious and "earthly" texts and the upholder and protector of reading in the Dark Ages) castigated and censored the printing of "heretica
l
" books (especially the vernacular bibles of the Reformation) and restored the Inquisition for the specific purpose of controlling book publishing. In 1559, it published the Index Librorum Prohibitorum ("Index of Prohibited Books"). A few (mainly Dutch) p
u
blishers even went to the stake (a habit worth reviving, some current authors would say...). European rulers issued proclamations against "naughty printed books" (of heresy and sedition). The printing of books was subject to licencing by the Privy Council
 
in England. The very concept of copyright arose out of the forced registration of books in the register of the English Stationer's Company (a royal instrument of influence and intrigue). Such obligatory registration granted the publisher the right to excl
usively copy the registered book (often, a class of books) for a number of years - but politically restricted printable content, often by force. Freedom of the press and free speech are still distant dreams in many corners of the earth. The Digital\~
Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA),\~the V-chip and other privacy invading, dissemination inhibiting, and censorship imposing measures perpetuate a veteran if not so venerable tradition.\~

\par }{\f1\fs20 The more it changes, the more it stays the same. If
 the history of the book teaches us anything it is that there are no limits to the ingenuity with which publishers, authors, and booksellers, re-invent old practices. Technological and marketing innovations are invariably perceived as threats - only to be
 
adopted later as articles of faith. Publishing faces the same issues and challenges it faced five hundred years ago and responds to them in much the same way. Yet, every generation believes its experiences to be unique and unprecedented. It is this denial
 
of the past that casts a shadow over the future. Books have been with us since the dawn of civilization, millennia ago. In many ways, books constitute our civilization. Their traits are its traits: resilience, adaptation, flexibility, self re-invention, w
ealth, communication. We would do well to accept that our most familiar artifacts - books - will never cease to amaze us. }{\f1\fs27

Data storage is the first phase. It is not as simple as it sounds. The proliferation of formats of digital content has made it necessary to develop a standard for archiving Internet objects. The size of the digitized collections must pose a serious challe
nge as far as timely retrieval is concerned. Interoperability issues (numerous formats and readers) probably requires software and hardware plug-ins to render a smooth and transparent user interface.}{\f1\fs27 
\par }{\f1\fs20 Moreover, as time passes, digital data, stored on magneti
c media, tend to deteriorate. It must be copied to newer media every 10 years or so ("migration"). Advances in hardware and software applications render many of the digital records indecipherable (try reading your word processing files from 1981, stored o
n
 5.25" floppies!). Special emulators of older hardware and software must be used to decode ancient data files. And, to ameliorate the impact of inevitable natural disasters, accidents, bankruptcies of publishers, and politically motivated destruction of d
ata - multiple copies and redundant systems and archives must be maintained.\~
As time passes, data formatting "dictionaries" will be needed. Data preservation is hardly useful if the data cannot be searched, retrieved, extracted, and researched. And, as "The
 Economist" put it ("The Economist Technology Quarterly, September 22nd, 2001), without a "Rosetta Stone" of data formats, future deciphering of stored the data might prove to be an insurmountable obstacle.}{\f1\fs27

\par }{\f1\fs20 Three years ago I published a book of short stories in Israel. The publishing house belongs to Israel's leading (and exceedingly wealthy) newspaper. I signed a contract which stated that I am entitle
d to receive 8% of the income from the sales of the book after commissions payable to distributors, shops, etc. A few months later (1997), I won the coveted Prize of the Ministry of Education (for short prose). The prize money (a few thousand DMs) was sna
tched by the publishing house on the legal grounds that all the money generated by the book belongs to them because they own the copyright. }{\f1\fs27 
\par }{\f1\fs20 In the mythology generated by capitalism to pacify the masses, the myth of intellectual property stands out. It goes
 like this : if the rights to intellectual property were not defined and enforced, commercial entrepreneurs would not have taken on the risks associated with publishing books, recording records, and preparing multimedia products. As a result, creative peo
ple will have suffered because they will have found no way to make their works accessible to the public. Ultimately, it is the public which pays the price of piracy, goes the refrain. }{\f1\fs27 
\par }{\f1\fs20 But this is factually untrue. In the USA there is a very limited group o
f authors who actually live by their pen. Only select musicians eke out a living from their noisy vocation (most of them rock stars who own their labels - George Michael had to fight Sony to do just that) and very few actors come close to deriving subsist
e
nce level income from their profession. All these can no longer be thought of as mostly creative people. Forced to defend their intellectual property rights and the interests of Big Money, Madonna, Michael Jackson, Schwarzenegger and Grisham are businessm
en at least as much as they are artists. }{\f1\fs27 
\par }{\f1\fs20 Economically and rationally, we should expect that the costlier a work of art is to produce and the narrower its market - the more emphasized its intellectual property rights. }{\f1\fs27 
\par }{\f1\fs20 Consider a publishing house. }{\f1\fs27 
\par }{\f1\fs20 
A book which costs 50,000 DM to produce with a potential audience of 1000 purchasers (certain academic texts are like this) - would have to be priced at a a minimum of 100 DM to recoup only the direct costs. If illegally copied (thereby shrinking the pote
n
tial market as some people will prefer to buy the cheaper illegal copies) - its price would have to go up prohibitively to recoup costs, thus driving out potential buyers. The story is different if a book costs 10,000 DM to produce and is priced at 20 DM 
a copy with a potential readership of 1,000,000 readers. Piracy (illegal copying) should in this case be more readily tolerated as a marginal phenomenon. }{\f1\fs27 
\par }{\f1\fs20 This is the theory. But the facts are tellingly different. The less the cost of production (brought do
wn by digital technologies) - the fiercer the battle against piracy. The bigger the market - the more pressure is applied to clamp down on samizdat entrepreneurs. }{\f1\fs27 
\par }{\f1\fs20 Governments, from China to Macedonia, are introducing intellectual property laws (under pres
sure from rich world countries) and enforcing them belatedly. But where one factory is closed on shore (as has been the case in mainland China) - two sprout off shore (as is the case in Hong Kong and in Bulgaria). }{\f1\fs27 
\par }{\f1\fs20 But this defies logic : the market today 
is global, the costs of production are lower (with the exception of the music and film industries), the marketing channels more numerous (half of the income of movie studios emanates from video cassette sales), the speedy recouping of the investment virtu
a
lly guaranteed. Moreover, piracy thrives in very poor markets in which the population would anyhow not have paid the legal price. The illegal product is inferior to the legal copy (it comes with no literature, warranties or support). So why should the big
 manufacturers, publishing houses, record companies, software companies and fashion houses worry? }{\f1\fs27 
\par }{\f1\fs20 The answer lurks in history. Intellectual property is a relatively new notion. In the near past, no one considered knowledge or the fruits of creativity (art,
 design) as 'patentable', or as someone's 'property'. The artist was but a mere channel through which divine grace flowed. Texts, discoveries, inventions, works of art and music, designs - all belonged to the community and could be replicated freely. True
,
 the chosen ones, the conduits, were honoured but were rarely financially rewarded. They were commissioned to produce their works of art and were salaried, in most cases. Only with the advent of the Industrial Revolution were the embryonic precursors of i
n
tellectual property introduced but they were still limited to industrial designs and processes, mainly as embedded in machinery. The patent was born. The more massive the market, the more sophisticated the sales and marketing techniques, the bigger the fi
n
ancial stakes - the larger loomed the issue of intellectual property. It spread from machinery to designs, processes, books, newspapers, any printed matter, works of art and music, films (which, at their beginning were not considered art), software, softw
are embedded in hardware, processes, business methods, and even unto genetic material. }{\f1\fs27 
\par }{\f1\fs20 Intellectual property rights - despite their noble title - are less about the intellect and more about property. This is Big Money : the markets in intellectual property
 outweigh the total industrial production in the world. The aim is to secure a monopoly on a specific work. This is an especially grave matter in academic publishing where small- circulation magazines do not allow their content to be quoted or published e
v
en for non-commercial purposes. The monopolists of knowledge and intellectual products cannot allow competition anywhere in the world - because theirs is a world market. A pirate in Skopje is in direct competition with Bill Gates. When he sells a pirated 
M
icrosoft product - he is depriving Microsoft not only of its income, but of a client (=future income), of its monopolistic status (cheap copies can be smuggled into other markets), and of its competition-deterring image (a major monopoly preserving asset)
. This is a threat which Microsoft cannot tolerate. Hence its efforts to eradicate piracy - successful in China and an utter failure in legally-relaxed Russia. }{\f1\fs27 
\par }{\f1\fs20 But what Microsoft fails to understand is that the problem lies with its pricing policy - not wi
th the pirates. When faced with a global marketplace, a company can adopt one of two policies: either to adjust the price of its products to a world average of purchasing power - or to use discretionary differential pricing (as pharmaceutical companies we
r
e forced to do in Brazil and South Africa). A Macedonian with an average monthly income of 160 USD clearly cannot afford to buy the Encyclopaedia Encarta Deluxe. In America, 50 USD is the income generated in 4 hours of an average job. In Macedonian terms,
 therefore, the Encarta is 20 times more expensive. Either the price should be lowered in the Macedonian market - or an average world price should be fixed which will reflect an average global purchasing power. }{\f1\fs27 
\par }{\f1\fs20 Something must be done about it not only from
 the economic point of view. Intellectual products are very price sensitive and highly elastic. Lower prices will be more than compensated for by a much higher sales volume. There is no other way to explain the pirate industries : evidently, at the right 
p
rice a lot of people are willing to buy these products. High prices are an implicit trade-off favouring small, elite, select, rich world clientele. This raises a moral issue : are the children of Macedonia less worthy of education and access to the latest
 in human knowledge and creation ? }{\f1\fs27 
\par }{\f1\fs20 Two developments threaten the future of intellectual property rights. One is the Internet. Academics, fed up with the monopolistic practices of professional publications - already publish on the web in big numbers. I publ
ished a few book on the Internet and they can be freely downloaded by anyone who has a computer or a modem. The full text of electronic magazines, trade journals, billboards, professional publications, and thousands of books is available online. Hackers e
v
en made sites available from which it is possible to download whole software and multimedia products. It is very easy and cheap to publish on the Internet, the barriers to entry are virtually nil. Web pages are hosted free of charge, and authoring and pub
lishing software tools are incorporated in most word processors and browser applications. As the Internet acquires more impressive sound and video capabilities it will proceed to threaten the monopoly of the record companies, the movie studios and so on. 
}{\f1\fs27 
\par }{\f1\fs20 T
he second development is also technological. The oft-vindicated Moore's law predicts the doubling of computer memory capacity every 18 months. But memory is only one aspect of computing power. Another is the rapid simultaneous advance on all technological
 
fronts. Miniaturization and concurrent empowerment by software tools have made it possible for individuals to emulate much larger scale organizations successfully. A single person, sitting at home with 5000 USD worth of equipment can fully compete with th
e
 best products of the best printing houses anywhere. CD-ROMs can be written on, stamped and copied in house. A complete music studio with the latest in digital technology has been condensed to the dimensions of a single chip. This will lead to personal pu
blishing, personal music recording, and the to the digitization of plastic art. But this is only one side of the story. }{\f1\fs27 
\par }{\f1\fs20 The relative advantage of the intellectual property corporation does not consist exclusively in its technological prowess. Rather it lie
s in its vast pool of capital, its marketing clout, market positioning, sales organization, and distribution network. }{\f1\fs27 
\par }{\f1\fs20 Nowadays, anyone can print a visually impressive book, using the above-mentioned cheap equipment. But in an age of information glut, it is the marketing, the media campaign, the distribution, and the sales that determine the economic outcome. }
{\f1\fs27 
\par }{\f1\fs20 This advantage, however, is also being eroded. }{\f1\fs27

\par }{\f1\fs20 Secondly, the Internet is a huge (200 million people), truly cosmopolitan market, with its own m

\par }{\f1\fs20 The demise of intellectual 
property has lately become abundantly clear. The old intellectual property industries are fighting tooth and nail to preserve their monopolies (patents, trademarks, copyright) and their cost advantages in manufacturing and marketing. }{\f1\fs27 
\par }{\f1\fs20 But they are faced with three inexorable processes which are likely to render their efforts vain:}{\f1\fs27 
\par }{\b\f1\fs20 The Newspaper Packaging}{\f1\fs20  }{\f1\fs27 
\par }{\f1\fs20 Print newspapers offer package deals of cheap content subsidized by advertising. In other words, the advertisers pay for content formation and generation 
and the reader has no choice but be exposed to commercial messages as he or she studies the content. }{\f1\fs27 
\par }{\f1\fs20 This model - adopted earlier by radio and television - rules the internet now and will rule the wireless internet in the future. Content will be made avai
lable free of all pecuniary charges. The consumer will pay by providing his personal data (demographic data, consumption patterns and preferences and so on) and by being exposed to advertising. Subscription based models are bound to fail. }{\f1\fs27 

\par }{\f1\fs20 Thus, content creators will benefit only by sharing in the advertising cake. They will find it increasingly difficult to implement the old models of royalties paid for access or of ownership of intellectual property.}{\f1\fs27 
\par }{\b\f1\fs20 Disintermediation}{\f1\fs20  }{\f1\fs27 
\par }{\f1\fs20 A lot of ink has been spilt regarding this important trend. The removal of layers of brokering and intermediation - mainly on the manufacturing and marketing levels - is a historic development (though the continuation of a long term trend). }{
\f1\fs27 
\par }{\f1\fs20 Consider music for instance. Streaming audio on th
e internet or downloadable MP3 files will render the CD obsolete. The internet also provides a venue for the marketing of niche products and reduces the barriers to entry previously imposed by the need to engage in costly marketing ("branding") campaigns 
and manufacturing activities. }{\f1\fs27 
\par }{\f1\fs20 This trend is also likely to restore the balance between artist and the commercial exploiters of his product. The very definition of "artist" will expand to include all creative people. One will seek to distinguish oneself, to
 "brand" oneself and to auction off one's services, ideas, products, designs, experience, etc. This is a return to pre-industrial times when artisans ruled the economic scene. Work stability will vanish and work mobility will increase in a landscape of sh
ifting allegiances, head hunting, remote collaboration and similar labour market trends.}{\f1\fs27 
\par }{\b\f1\fs20 Market Fragmentation}{\f1\fs20  }{\f1\fs27 
\par }{\f1\fs20 In a fragmented market with a myriad of mutually exclusive market niches, consumer preferences and marketing and sales channels - economies of sca
le in manufacturing and distribution are meaningless. Narrowcasting replaces broadcasting, mass customization replaces mass production, a network of shifting affiliations replaces the rigid owned-branch system. The decentralized, intrapreneurship-based co
rporation is a late response to these trends. The mega-corporation of the future is more likely to act as a collective of start-ups than as a homogeneous, uniform (and, to conspiracy theorists, sinister) juggernaut it once was. }{\f1\fs27

\par {\*\bkmkend territorial}By: Sam Vaknin
\par }{\f1\fs27 \~
\par }{\f1\fs20 The Net was supposed to dissolve anachronistic national borders and cultural boundaries. It was expected to vitiate distance - both physical and mental. It was hailed as the invention that will unify Mankind 
and harmonize (though not homogenize) civilizations, east and west.}{\f1\fs27 
\par }{\f1\fs20 Yet, this was not to be. As dot.coms bombed, their more veteran and more experienced brick and mortar rivals took over the Net, transforming it in the process into a giant content delivery
, marketing, supply chain management, and customer relationship management platform. This evolution all but demolished the non-local nature of the early Internet. It has also brought it into the remit of existing national laws.}{\f1\fs27 
\par }{\f1\fs20 Moreover, governments throug
hout the world have become more assertive in exercising territorial jurisdiction over the hitherto ostensibly extraterritorial Net. A French court has prohibited Yahoo! from making certain content on its Web sites available to French citizens. An American
 
court advised Yahoo! to ignore this decision. A Russian programmer was arrested by the FBI for offering a decryption software for sale in Russia (where it is perfectly legal). Governments from China to Saudi Arabia filter Web content regularly. Following 
the September 11 attacks, restrictive anti-terrorist legislation the world over targeted cyberspace.}{\f1\fs27 
\par }{\f1\fs20 But the real territorialization of the Internet - the redrawing of its internal contours and the withdrawal of its libertarian foundations - is more pernici
ous, all-pervasive, quotidian, and surreptitiously gradual. This is not the outcome of legal revolutions and court-driven evolution. It is piecemeal, quiet, unnoticed, often inadvertent and unintended. It is an "afterthought" rather than a premeditated "p
lot". It happens e-tailer by e-tailer, one Web site after the other, like the spread of a virus.}{\f1\fs27 
\par }{\f1\fs20 Consider these two - by no means exhaustive - examples. }{\f1\fs27 
\par }{\f1\fs20 Amazon and Geocities (now, Yahoo!Geocities) are two Internet establishments, two gigantic communities of users that, between them, represent a sizable chunk of all the activity on the Internet. }{\f1\fs27 
\par }{\f1\fs20 It has long been impossible for a non-US publisher to sell its wares (books, for instance) through Amazon or to Amazon directly. Amazon works exclusively with US pu
blishers and distributors. To collaborate with Amazon - one of the members of a duopoly as far as B2C e-commerce goes - a non-US publisher (no matter how substantial) has to work with a US distributor and thus forgo a large portion of its revenues (payabl
e
 to the distributor as commissions). Moreover, said publisher cannot even open a ZShop (Amazon's version of mom and pop store). One has to be a US resident to do so. Amazon is closed to the outside world, despite its (false) global image. It sells all ove
r the world - but it only buys American.}{\f1\fs27 
\par }{\f1\fs20 This discriminatory behaviour is partly profit-motivated. It is logistically easier and cheaper to deal only with US businesses. But Barnes and Noble works directly with foreign publishers and they preceded Amazon in
 the book business by decades. }{\f1\fs27 
\par }{\f1\fs20 Yahoo!Geocities has lately instituted a new policy. It limits the size of downloads from the free home pages of members of its community. If the downloaded content from a given home page exceeds 3 Gb (extrapolated based on h
ourly usage) - the "offending" member's page is shut down for an hour. The member is then prompted to pay a monthly subscription fee for a Premium Service in order avoid a recurrence of this unfortunate event. This "marketing drive" is intended to compens
ate Yahoo!Geocities for a precipitous drop in online advertising revenues.}{\f1\fs27 
\par }{\f1\fs20 The "Premium" package includes "Premium Mail". But only US citizens or residents can subscribe to it. And, you guessed it right, without the Premium Mail component, one cannot comple
te the subscription process. Though not stated explicitly anywhere, the Premium services are closed to the outside world and are the exclusive reserve of Americans. One can get around this virtual ethnic cleansing by providing false data while registering
, but this is besides the point.}{\f1\fs27 
\par }{\f1\fs20 The Internet is a reflection of the outside world. As economies contract, unemployment soars, personal safety vanishes, the social fabric disintegrates, and consumption slumps - countries tend to isolate themselves political
ly, react aggressively, and protect their national economies. Protectionism, unilateralism, and isolationism are scourges the Internet was supposed to be immune to. Little did we know.}{\f1\fs27

\par }{\f1\fs20 People are conditioned to trust written words, not to mention images. "I read it in the paper" or "As seen on TV" are worn out but still effective clich\'e9s. The Internet combines both
 the written and the seen. It is both a textual and a visual (and audio) medium. Do people trust Internet content? Is the incredible Internet - credible?}{\f1\fs27 
\par }{\f1\fs20 In the "brick and mortar" world, credibility is associated with brands. A brand, in effect, guarantees
 the quality and specifications of a product (think McDonald's hamburgers), its performance (think Palm), level of service and commitment to customer care (Amazon), variety, or price (Wal-Mart). Brands are sustained and enhanced by advertising campaigns. 
The content or sales pitch of specific ads are often less important than the message conveyed by the very existence of a campaign: "This company is rich enough (read: stable, reliable, trustworthy, here to stay) to spend millions on advertising".\~ }{
\f1\fs27 
\par }{\f1\fs20 The Inte
rnet has very few brands (Yahoo!, Amazon) - and some of them are tarnished. Some "old media" brands have entered the fray (Barnes and Noble, The Wall Street Journal, the Britannica) - hitherto without much success. The overwhelming bulk of Web content is 
created or disseminated by small time entrepreneurs and monomaniacs. }{\f1\fs27

The Credibility Web discovered that trust in e-commerce is also influenced by idiosyncratic factors. Certain domain names (org) are more trusted than others (com). Too many ads, broken links, typos, outdated or old content - all diminish
 trust. In the absence of proven markers and behavioral guidelines, people seem to resort to extrapolation ("if they can't maintain their own Web site ...") and stereotypes (e.g., NGO's are more trustworthy than corporations).}{\f1\fs27 
\par }{\f1\fs20 As Web sites proliferate (Goo
gle indexes well over 3 billion now) and Web authoring becomes a routine task - the noise to signal ratio of garbage to useful information is bound to deteriorate. Search engines already incorporate crude measures of credibility in their rankings (e.g., t
he number of links from external Web sites). But, to remain useful, search engines (and Web directories) would do well to rate Web content more comprehensively and thoroughly. They should rank Web sites by\~
 authoritativeness, reliability, and objectivity, for instance. }{\f1\fs27 
\par }{\f1\fs20 Research shows that 75% of all respondents resort to the Internet as a primary information provider. The inundation of irrelevant material caused most surfers to confine their surfing to 10 Web sites (the equivalent of "anchors" in shopping m
alls), which they deem reliable, timely, accurate, objective, authoritative, and credible. The rest of the Internet gets the leftovers.\~
 This worrying trend can be reversed only through the emergence of independent and commercially-viable rating agencies. 
Web sites (at least the business ones) should be willing to pay for credible rating to enhance their stickiness and attract monetizable "eyeballs". In the absence of such third party accreditation, the Internet risks both irrelevance and disrepute.

 where the deep web comes in. Databases are about internal links. Hitherto they existed in splendid isolation, universes closed but to the most persistent and knowledgeable. This may be \line 
about to change. The flood of quality relevant information this will unleash will dramatically dwarf anything that preceded it.

\par }{\f1\fs20 The hype over ubiquitous (or pervasive) computing (computers everywhere) has 
masked a potentially more momentous development. It is the convergence of computing devices interfaces with web (or other) content. Years ago - after Bill Gates overcame his misplaced\~
scepticism - Microsoft introduced their "internet-ready" applications. I
ts word processing software ("Word"), other Office applications, and the Windows operating system handle both "local" documents (resident on the user's computer) and web pages smoothly and seamlessly. The transition between the desktop or laptop interface
s and the web is today effortlessly transparent.}{\fs20 
\par \~
\par }{\f1\fs20 The introduction of e-book readers and MP3 players has blurred the anachronistic distinction between hardware and software. Common speech reflects this fact. When we say "e-book", we mean both the device an
d the content we access on it. As technologies such as digital ink and printable integrated circuits mature - hardware and software will have completed their inevitable merger.}{\fs20 
\par \~
\par }{\f1\fs20 This erasure of boundaries has led to the emergence of knowledge management s
olutions and personal and shared workspaces. The LOCATION of a document (one's own computer, a colleague's PDA, or a web page) has become irrelevant. The NATURE of the document (e-mail message, text file, video snippet, soundbite) is equally unimportant. 
T
he SOURCE of the document (its extension, which tells us on which software it was created and can be read) is increasingly meaningless. Universal languages (such as Java) allow devices and applications to talk to each other. What matters are accessibility
 and logical and user-friendly work-flows.}{\fs20

anding and customization opportunities on and offline, a unique, private communication channel to users that can be used also for eBusiness solutions, ...Knowledge Management solution that requires no user set-up or configuration."}{\fs20 
\par \~
\par }{\f1\fs20 The principle is simpl
e enough - but the experience is liberating (try their online flash demo). Suddenly, instead of juggling dozens of windows, a single interface provides the tortured user (that's I) with access to all his applications: e-mail, contacts, documents, the comp
any's intranet or network, the web and OPC's (other people's computers, other networks, other intranets). There is only a single screen and it is dynamically and automatically updated to respond to the changing information needs of the user.}{\fs20 

\par \~
\par }{\f1\fs20 "The power un
derlying Enfish Onespace is its patented DEX 'engine.' This technology creates a master, cross-referenced index of the contents of a user's email, documents and Internet information. The Enfish engine then uses this master index as a basis to understand w

at is relevant to a user, and to provide them with appropriate information. In this manner Enfish Onespace 'personalizes' the Internet for each user, automatically connecting relevant information and services from the Internet with the user's desktop info
rmation.}{\fs20

As an example, by clicking on a person or company, Enfish Onespace automatically assembles a page that brings together related emails, documents, contact information, appointments, news and relevant news headlines from the Internet. This is accomp

is results in ... benefits in productivity and efficiency."}{\fs20 
\par \~
\par }{\f1\fs20 It is, indeed, addictive. The inevitable advent of transparent computing (smart houses, smart cards, smart clothes, smart appliances, wireless Internet) - coupled with the single GUI (Graphic Use

The Internet may have started as the fervent brainchild of DARPA, the US defence agency - but it quickly evolved into a network of computers at the service of a community. Academics around the world used it to communicate, compare results, compute, intera
c
t and flame each other. The ethos of the community as content-creator, source of information, fount of emotional sustenance, peer group, and social substitute is well embedded in the very fabric of the Net. Millions of members in free, advertising or subs
c
ription financed, mega-sites such as Geocities, AOL, Yahoo and Tripod generate more bits and bytes than the rest of the Internet combined. This traffic emanates from discussion groups, announcement (mailing) lists, newsgroups, and content sites (such as S
uite101 and Webseed). Even the occasional visitor can find priceless gems of knowledge and opinion in the mound of trash and frivolity that these parts of the web have become. }{\fs20 
\par }{\f1\fs20 The emergence of search engines and directories which cater only to this (sizeab
le) market segment was to be expected. By far the most comprehensive (and, thus, less discriminating) was Deja. It spidered and took in the exploding newsgroups (Usenet) scene with its tens of thousands of daily messages. When it was taken over by Google,
 its archives contained more than 500 million messages, cross-indexed\~ every which way and pertaining to every possible (and many impossible) a topic. }{\fs20 
\par }{\f1\fs20 Google is by far the most popular search engine yet, having surpassed the more veteran Northern Lights, F
ast, and Alta Vista. Its mind defying database (more than 1.3 billion web pages), its caching technology (making it, in effect, one of the biggest libraries on earth) and its site ranking (by popularity and links-over) have rendered it unbeatable. Yet, it
s
 efforts to integrate the treasure trove that is Deja and adapt it to the Google search interface have hitherto been spectacularly unsuccessful (though it finally made it two and a half months after the purchase). So much so, that it gave birth to a prote
st movement. }{\fs20 
\par }{\f1\fs20 Bickering and bad tempered flaming (often bordering on the deranged, the racial, or the stalking) are the more repulsive aspects of the Usenet groups. But at the heart of the debate this time is no ordinary sadistic venting. The issue is: who 
owns content generated by the public at large on computers funded by tax dollars? Can a commercial enterprise own and monopolize the fruits of the collective effort of millions of individuals from all over the world? Or should such intellectual property r
e
main in the public domain, perhaps maintained by public institutions (such as the Library of Congress)? Should open source movements gain access to Deja's source code in order to launch Deja II? And who owns the copyright to all these messages (theoretica
lly, the authors)? Google, as Deja before it, is offering compilations of this content, the copyright to which it does not and cannot own. The very legal concept of intellectual property is at the crux of this virtual conflict. }{\fs20 
\par }{\f1\fs20 Google was, thus, compelled 
to offer free access to the CONTENT of the Deja archives to alternative (non-Google) archiving systems. But it remains mum on the search programming code and the user interface. Already one such open source group (called Dela News) is coalescing, although
 it is not clear who will bear the costs of the gigantic storage and processing such a project would require. Dela wants to have a physical copy of the archive deposited in trust with a dot org. }{\fs20 
\par }{\f1\fs20 This raises a host of no less fascinating subjects. The Deja 
Usenet search technology, programming code, and systems are inextricable and almost indistinguishable from the Usenet archive itself. Without these elements - structural as well as dynamic - there will be no archive and no way to extract meaningful inform
a
tion from the chaotic bedlam that is the Usenet environment. In this case, the information lies in the ordering and classification of raw data and not in the content itself. This is why the open source proponents demand that Google share both content and 
the tools to access it. Google's hasty and improvised unplugging of Deja in February only served to aggravate the die-hard fans of erstwhile Deja. }{\fs20 
\par }{\f1\fs20 The Usenet is not only the refuge of pedophiles and neo-Nazis. It includes thousands of academically rigorous
 and research inclined discussion groups which morph with intellectual trends and fashionable subjects. More than twenty years of wisdom and erudition are buried in servers all over the world. Scholars often visit Usenet in their pursuit of complementary 
k
nowledge or expert advice. The Usenet is also the documentation of Western intellectual history in the last three decades. In it invaluable. Google's decision to abandon the internal links between Deja messages means the disintegration of the hyperlinked 
fabric of this resource - unless Google comes up with an alternative (and expensive) solution. }{\fs20 
\par }{\f1\fs20 Google is offering a better, faster, more multi-layered and multi-faceted access to the entire archive. But its brush with the more abrasive side of the open sou
rce movement brought to the surface long suppressed issues. This may be the single most important contribution of this otherwise not so opportune transaction. \line \~ }{\fs20

These metaphors prove to be very useful (even business-wise). They permit us to define the commercial opportunities embedded in the Internet. 
\par Yet, they fail to assist us in predicting its future in its transformation into a medium. 
\par How does a
n invention become a medium? What happens to it when it does become one? What is the thin line separating the initial functioning of the invention from its transformation into a new medium? In other words: when can we tell that some technological advance 
gave birth to a new medium? 
\par This work also deals with the image of the Internet once transformed into a medium. 
\par The Internet has the most unusual attributes in the history of media. 
\par It has no central structure or organization. It is hardware and software
 independent. It (almost) cannot be subjected to legislation or to regulation. Consider the example of downloading music from the internet - is it tantamount to an act of recording music (a violation of copyright laws)? This has been the crux of the legal
 battle between Diamond Multimedia (the manufacturers of the Rio MP3 device), MP3.com and Napster and the recording industry in America. 
\par The Internet's data transfer channels are not linear - they are random. Most of its "broadcast" cannot be "received" at
 all. It allows for the narrowest of narrowcasting through the use of e-mail mailing lists, discussion groups, message boards, private radio stations, and chats. And this is but a small portion of an impressive list of oddities. These idiosyncrasies will 
also shape the nature of the Internet as a medium. Growing out of bizarre roots - it is bound to yield strange fruit as a medium. 
\par So what business opportunities does the Internet represent?

\par How many Internet users are there? How many of them have access to the Web (World Wide Web - WWW) and use it? There are no unequivocal statistics. Those who presume to give the answers (including the ISOC - the Internet SOCiety) - rely on very partial and
 biased resources. Others just bluff. 
\par Yet, everyone seems to agree that there are, at least, 100 million active participants in North America (the Nielsen and Commerce-Net reports). 
\par The future is, inevitably, even more vague than the present. Authoritativ
e consultancy firms predict 66 million active users in 10 years time. IBM envisages 700 million users. MCI is more modest with 300 million. At the end of 1999 there were 130 million registered (though not necessarily active) users. 
\par }{\cs15\b\i The Internet - an Elitist and Chauvinistic Medium }{
\par The average user of the Internet is young (30), with an academic background and high income. The percentage of the educated and the well-to-do among the users of the Web is three times as high as their proportion in the populati
on. This is fast changing only because their children are joining them (6 million already had access to the Internet at the end of 1996 - and were joined by another 24 million by the end of the decade). This may change only due to presidential initiatives
 
to bridge the "digital divide" (from Al Gore's in the USA to Mahatir Mohammed's in Malaysia), corporate largesse and institutional involvement (e.g., Open Society in Eastern Europe, Microsoft in the USA). These efforts will spread the benefits of this all
-powerful tool among the less privileged. A bit less than 50% of all users are men but they are responsible for 60% of the activity in the net (as measured by traffic). 
\par Women seem to limit themselves to electronic mail (e-mail) and to electronic shopping of goods and services, though this is changing fast. Men prefer information, either due to career requirements or because knowledge is power. 
\par Most of the users are of the "experiencer" variety. They are leaders of social change and innovative. This breed i
nhabits universities, fashionable neighbourhoods and trendy vocations. This is why some wonder if the Internet is not just another fad, albeit an incredibly resilient and promising one. 
\par Most users have home access to the Internet - yet, they still prefer 
to access it from work, at their employer's expense, though this preference is slight and being eroded. Most users are, therefore, exploitative in nature. Still, we must not forget that there are 37 million households of the self-employed and this possibl
y distorts the statistical picture somewhat. 
\par }{\b\i The Internet - A Western Phenomenon}{ 
\par Not African, not Asian (with the exception of Israel and Japan), not Russian , nor a Third World phenomenon. It belongs squarely to the wealthy, sated world. It is the indulg
ence of those who have everything and whose greatest concern is their choice of nightly entertainment. Between 50-60% of all Internet users live in the USA, 5-10% in Canada. The Internet is catching on in Europe (mainly in Germany and in Scandinavia) and,
 in its mobile form (i-mode) in Japan. The Internet lost to the French Minitel because the latter provides more locally relevant content and because of high costs of communications and hardware. 
\par }{\b\i Communications}{ 
\par Most computer owners still possess a 28,800 b
ps modem. This is much like driving a bicycle on a German Autobahn. The 56,600 bps is gradually replacing its slower predecessor (48% of computers with modems) - but even this is hardly sufficient. To begin to enjoy video and audio (especially the former)
 - data transfer rates need to be 50 times faster. 
\par Half the households in the USA have at least 2 telephones and one of them is usually dedicated to data processing (faxes or fax-modems). 
\par The ISDN could constitute the mid-term solution. This data transfer network is fairly speedy and covers 70% of the territory of the USA. It is growing by 100% annually and its sales topped 10 billion USD in 1995/6. 
\par Unfortunately, it is quite clear that ISDN is not THE answer. It is too slow, too user-unfriendly, has a ba
d interface with other network types, it requires special hardware. There is no point in investing in temporary solutions when the right solution is staring the Internet in the face, though it is not implemented due to political circumstances. 
\par A cable mod
em is 80 times speedier than the ISDN and 700 times faster than a 14,400 bps modem. However, it does have problems in accommodating a two-way data transfer. There is also need to connect the fibre optic infrastructure which characterizes cable companies t
o
 the old copper coaxial infrastructure which characterizes telephony. Cable users engage specially customized LANs (Ethernet) and the hardware is expensive (though equipment prices are forecast to collapse as demand increases). Cable companies simply did

ot invest in developing the technology. The law (prior to the 1996 Communications Act) forbade them to do anything that was not one way transfer of video via cables. Now, with the more liberal regulative environment, it is a mere question of time until th
e technology is found. 
\par Actually, most consumers single out bad customer relations as their biggest problem with the cable companies - rather than technology. 
\par Experiments conducted with cable modems led to a doubling of usage time (from an average of 24 to
 47 hours per month per user) which was wholly attributable to the increased speed. This comes close to a cultural revolution in the allocation of leisure time. Numerically speaking: 7 million households in the USA are fitted with a two-way data transfer 
cable modems. This is a small number and it is anyone's guess if it constitutes a critical mass. Sales of such modems amount to 1.3 billion USD annually. 
\par 50% of all cable subscribers also have a PC at home. To me it seems that the merging of the two technologies is inevitable. 
\par Other technological solutions - such as DSL, ADSL, and the more promising satellite broadband - are being developed and implemented, albeit slowly and inefficiently. Coverage is sporadic and frustrating waiting periods are measured in months. 
\par }{\b\i Hardware and Software}{ 
\par Most Internet users (82%) work with the Windows operating system. About 11% own a Macintosh (much stronger graphically and more user-friendly). Only 7% continue to work on UNIX based systems (which, historically, fathered 
the Internet) - and this number is fast declining. A strong entrant is the free source LINUX operating system. 
\par Virtually all users surf through a browsing software. A fast dwindling minority (26%) use Netscape's products (mainly Navigator and Communicator
) and the majority use Microsoft's Explorer (more than 60% of the market). Browsers are now free products and can be downloaded from the Internet. As late as 1997, it was predicted by major Internet consultancy firms that browser sales will top $4 billion
 by the year 2000. Such misguided predictions ignored the basic ethos of the Internet: free products, free content, free access.
\par Browsers are in for a great transformation. Most of them are likely to have 3-D, advanced audio, telephony / voice / video mail 
(v-mail), instant messaging, e-mail, and video conferencing capabilities integrated into the same browsing session. They will become self-customizing, intelligent, Internet interfaces. They will memorize the history of usage and user preferences and adapt
 themselves accordingly. They will allow content-specificity: unidentifiable smart agents will scour the Internet, make recommendations, compare prices, order goods and services and customize contents in line with self-adjusting user profiles. 
\par Two important technological developments must be considered: 
\par PDAs (Personal Digital Assistants) - the ultimate personal (and office) communicators, easy to carry, they provide Internet (access) Everywhere, independent of suppliers and providers and of phy
sical infrastructure (in an aeroplane, in the field, in a cinema). 
\par The second trend: wireless data transfer and wireless e-mail, whether through pagers, cellular phones, or through more sophisticated apparatus and hybrids such as smart phones. Geotech\rquote s p
roducts are an excellent example: e-mail, faxes, telephone calls and a connection to the Internet and to other, public and corporate, or proprietary, databases - all provided by the same gadget. This is the embodiment of the electronic, physically detache
d, office. Wearable computing should be considered a part of this "ubiquitous or pervasive computing" wave. 
\par We have no way of gauging - or intelligently guessing - the part of the mobile Internet in the total future Internet market but it is likely to outw
eigh the "fixed" part. Wireless internet meshes well with the trend of pervasive computing and the intelligent home and office. Household gadgets such as microwave ovens, refrigerators and so on will connect to the internet via a wireless interface to cul
l
 data, download information, order goods and services, report their condition and perform basic maintenance functions. Location specific services (navigation, shopping recommendations, special discounts, deals and sales, emergency services) depend on the 
technological confluence between GPS (stallite-based geolocation technology) and wireless Internet.
\par }{\b\i Suppliers and Intermediaries}{ 
\par "Parasitic" intermediaries occupy each stage in the Internet's food chain. 
\par Access to the Internet is still provided by "dumb pipes" - the Internet Service Providers (ISP) 
\par Content is still the preserve of content suppliers and so on. 
\par Some of these intermediaries are doomed to gradually fade or to suffer a substantial diminishing of their share of the market. Even "walled gardens" of content (such as AOL) are at risk.
\par By way of comparison, even today, ISPs have four times as many subscribers (worldwide) as AOL. Admittedly, this adversely affects the quality of the Internet - the infrastructure maintained by the phone companies is 
slow and often succumbs to bottlenecks. The unequivocal intention of the telephony giants to become major players in the Internet market should also be taken into account. The phone companies will, thus, play a dual role: they will provide access to their
 
infrastructure to their competitors (sometimes, within a real or actual monopoly) - and they will compete with their clients. The same can be said about the cable companies. Controlling the last mile to the user's abode is the next big business of the Int
ernet. Companies such as AOL are disadvantaged by these trends. It is imperative for AOL to obtain equal access to the cable company's backbone and infrastructure if it wants to survive. Hence its merger with Time Warner. 
\par No wonder that many of the ISPs ju
dge this intrusion on their turf by the phone and cable companies to constitute unfair competition. Yet, one should not forget that the barriers to entry are very low in the ISP market. It takes a minimal investment to become an ISP. 200 modems (which cos
t 200 USD each) are enough to satisfy the needs of 2000 average users who generate an income of 500,000 USD per annum to the ISP. Routers are equally as cheap nowadays. This is a nice return on the ISP\rquote s capital, undoubtedly. 
\par }{\b\i The Hitchhikers}{ 
\par The Web house
s the equivalent of 100 billion pages. Search Engine applications are used to locate specific information in this impressive, constantly proliferating library. They will be replaced, in the near future, by "Knowledge Structures" - gigantic encyclopaedias,
 
whose text will contain references (hyperlinks) to other, relevant, sites. The far future will witness the emergence of the "Intelligent Archives" and the "Personal Newspapers" (read further for detailed explanations). Some software applications will summ
a
rize content, others will index and automatically reference and hyperlink texts (virtual bibliographies). An average user will have an on-going interest in 500 sites. Special software will be needed to manage address books ("bookmarks", "favourites") and 
c
ontents ("Intelligent Addressbooks"). The phenomenon of search engines dedicated to search a number of search engines simultaneously will grow ("Hyper- or meta- engines"). Meta-engines will work in the background and download hyperlinks and advertising (t
h
e latter is essential to secure the financial interest of site developers and owners). Statistical software which tracks ("how long was what done"), monitors ("what did they do while in the site") and counts ("how many") visitors to sites already exists. 
Some of these applications have back-office facilities (accounting, follow-up, collections, even tele-marketing). They all provide time trails and some allow for auditing. 
\par This is but a small fragment of the rapidly developing net-scape: people and enterpr
ises who make a living off the Internet craze rather than off the Internet itself. Everyone knows that there is more money in lecturing about how to make money on the Internet - than in the Internet itself. This maxim still holds true despite the 32 billi
o
n US dollars in E-commerce in 1998. Business to Consumer (B2C) sales grow less vigorously than Business to Business (B2B) sales and are likely to suffer another blow with the advent of Peer to Peer (P2P) computer networks. The latter allow PCs to act as s
ervers and thus enable the swapping of computer files asmong connected users (with or without a central directory). 
\par }{\b\i Content Suppliers}{ 
\par This is the underprivileged sector of the Internet. They all lose money (even e-tailers which offer basic, standardized g
oods - books, CDs - with the exception, until September 11, of sites connected to tourism). No one thanks them for content produced with the investment of a lot of effort and a lot of money. A really qualitative, fully commerce enabled site costs up to 5,
0
00,000 USD, excluding site maintenance and customer and visitor services. Content providers are constantly criticized for lack of creativity or for too much creativity. More and more is asked of them. They are exploited by intermediaries, hitchhikers and 
other parasites. This is all an off-shoot of the ethos of the Internet as a free content area. 
\par More than 100 million men and women constantly access the Web - but this number stands to grow (the median prediction: 300 million). Yet, while the Web is used b
y 35% of those with access to the Internet - e-mail is used by more than 60%. E-mail is by far the most common function ("killer app") and specialized applications (Eudora, Internet Mail, Microsoft Exchange) - free or ad sponsored - keep it accessible to 
all and user-friendly. 
\par Most of the users like to surf (browse, visit sites) the net without reason or goal in mind. This makes it difficult to apply traditional marketing techniques. 
\par What is the meaning of "targeted audiences" or "market shares" in this context? 
\par If a surfer visits sites which deal with aberrant sex and nuclear physics in the same session - what to make of it? 
\par The public and legislative backlash against the gathering of surfers' data by Internet ad agencies and other web sites - has led to growing ignorance regarding the profile of Internet users, their demography, habits, preferences and dislikes. 
\par People like the very act of surfing. They want to be entertained, then they use the Internet as a working tool, mostly in the service of their employer, who, usually foots the bill. Users love free downloads (mainly software). 
\par "Free" is a key word on the Internet: it used to belong to the US Government and to a bunch of universities. Users like information, with emphasis on news and data about 
new products. But they do not like to shop on the net - yet. Only 38% of all surfers made a purchase during 1998. 
\par 67% of them adore virtual sex. 50% of the sites most often visited are porn sites (this is reminiscent of the early days of the Video Cassett
e Recorder - VCR). People dedicate the same amount of time to watching video cassettes or television as they do to surfing the net. The Internet seems to cannibalize television. 
\par Sex is followed by music, sports, health, television, computers, cinema, poli
tics, pets and cooking sites. People are drawn to interactive games. The Internet will shortly enable people to gamble, if not hampered by legislation. 10 billion USD in gambling money are predicted to pass through the net. This makes sense: nothing like 
a computer to provide immediate (monetary and psychological) rewards. 
\par Commerce on the net is another favourite. The Internet is a perfect medium for the sale of software and other digital products (e-books). The problem of data security is on its way to being solved with the SET (or other) world standard. 
\par As early as 1995, the Internet had more than 100 virtual shopping malls visited by 2.5 million shoppers (and probably double this number in 1996). 
\par The predictions for 1999 were between 1-5 billion USD of net shopping (plus 2 billion USD through on-line information providers, such as CompuServe and AOL) - proved woefully inaccurate. The actual number in 1998 was 7 times the prediction for 1999. 

\par It is also widely believed that circa 20% of the family budget will pass through the Internet as e-money and this amounts to 150 billion USD. 
\par The Internet will become a giant inter-bank clearing system and varied ATM type banking and investment services will be provided through it. Basically, everything can be done through the Internet: looking for a job, for instance. 
\par Yet, the Internet will never replace human interaction. People are likely to prefer personal banking, window shopping and the social experience of the shopping mall to Internet banking and e-commerce, or m-commerce. 
\par Some sites already sport classified ads. This is not a bad way to defray expenses, though most classified ads are free (it is the advertising they attract that matters). 
\par Another developing trend is website-rating and critique. It will be treated the way today\rquote s printed editions are. It will have a limited influence on the consumption decisions of some users. Browsers already sport buttons labelled "What\rquote 
s New" and "What's Hot". Most Search Engines recommend specific sites. Users are cautious. Studies discovered that no user, no matter how heavy, has consistently re-vis
ited more than 200 sites, a minuscule number. The 10 most popular web sites (Yahoo!, MSN, etc.) attracted more than 50% of all Internet traffic. Site recommendation services often produce random - at times, wrong - selections for their user. There are als
o concerns regarding privacy issues. The backlah against Amazon's "readers' circles" is an example. 
\par Web Critics, who work today mainly for the printed press, will publish their wares on the net and will link to intelligent software which will hyperlink, re
commend and refer. Some web critics will be identified with specific applications - really, expert systems which will incorporate their knowledge and experience. 
\par }{\b\i The Money}{ 
\par Where will the capital needed to finance all these developments come from? 
\par Again, there are two schools: 
\par One says that sites will be financed through advertising - and so will search engines and other applications accessed by users. 
\par Certain ASPs (Application Service Providers which rent out access to application software which resides on their servers) are considering this model. 
\par The second version is simpler and allows for the existence of non-commercial content. 
\par It proposes to collect negligible sums (cents or fractions of cents) from every user for every visit ("micro-payments") 
or a subscription fee. These accumulated cents or subscription fees will enable the owners of old sites to update and to maintain them and encourage entrepreneurs to develop new ones. Certain content aggregators (especially of digital textbooks) have adop
ted this model (Questia, Fathom). 
\par The adherents of the first school pointed at the 5 million USD invested in advertising during 1995 and to the 60 million or so invested during 1996. 
\par Its opponents point exactly at the same numbers: ridiculously small when
 contrasted with more conventional advertising modes. The potential of advertising on the net is limited to 1.5 billion USD annually in 1998, thundered the pessimists (many thought that even half that would be very nice). The actual figure was double the 
prediction but still woefully small and inadequate to support the Internet's content development. 
\par Compare these figures to the sale of Internet software ($4 billion), Internet hardware ($3 billion), Internet access provision ($4.2 billion) in 1995. 
\par Hembrecht and Quist estimated that Internet related industries scooped up 23.2 billion USD annually (A report released in mid-1996). 
\par And what follows advertising is hardly more enocuraging.
\par The consumer interacts and the product is delivered to him. This - the 
delivery phase - is a slow and enervating epilogue to the exciting affair of ordering through the net at the speed of light. Too many consumers still complain that they do not receive what they ordered, or that delivery is late and products defective. 

\par The solution may lie in the integration of advertising and content. Pointcast, for instance, integrated advertising into its news broadcasts, continuously streamed to the user\rquote 
s screen, even when inactive (they provided a downloadable active screen saver and 
ticker in a "push technology"). Downloading of digital music, video and text (e-books) will lead to immediate gratification of the consumer and will increase the efficacy of advertising. 
\par Whatever the case may be, a uniform, agreed upon system of rating as a basis for charging advertisers, is sorely needed. There is also the question of what does the advertiser pay for? 
\par Many advertisers (Procter and Gamble, for instance) refuse to pay according to the number of hits or impressions (=entries, visits to a site). They agree to pay only according to the number of the times that their advertisement was hit (page views).

\par This different basis for calculation is likely to upset all revenue scenarios. 
\par Very few sites of important, respectable newspapers are on a subscription basis. Dow Jones (Wall Street Journal) and The Economist, to mention but two. 
\par Will this become the prevailing trend?

\par }{\b\i The Internet as a Chaotic Library}{ 
\par }{\b 1. The Problem of Cataloguing}{
\par The Internet is an assortment of billions of pages containing information. Some of them are visible and others are generated from hidden databases by users' requests ("Invisible Internet"). 
\par The Internet displays no discernible order, classification, or categorization. As opposed to "classical" libraries, no one has invented a cataloguing standard (remember Dewey?). This is so needed that it is amazing that it has not been invented yet. Some 
sites indeed apply the Dewey Decimal Syatem (Suite101). Others default to a directory structure (Open Directory, Yahoo!, Look Smart and others). 
\par Had such a standard existed (an agreed upon numerical cataloguing method) - each site would have self-classifie
d. Sites would have an interest to do so to increase their penetration rates and their visibility. This, naturally, would have eliminated the need for today's clunky, incomplete and (highly) inefficient search engines. 
\par A site whose number starts with 900 
will be immediately identified as dealing with history and multiple classification will be encouraged to allow finer cross-sections to emerge. An example of such an emerging technology of "self classification" and "self-publication" (though limited to sch
olarly resources) is the "Academic Resource Channel" by Scindex. 
\par Users will not be required to remember reams of numbers. Future browsers will be akin to catalogues, very much like the applications used in modern day libraries. Compare this utopia to the c
urrent dystopy. Users struggle with reams of irrelevant material to finally reach a partial and disappointing destination. At the same time, there likely are web sites which exactly match the poor user's needs. Yet, what currently determines the chances o
f a happy encounter between user and content - are the whims of the specific search engine used and things like meta-tags, headlines, a fee paid, or the right opening sentences. 
\par }{\b 2. Screen versus Page}{
\par The computer screen, because of physical limitations (si
ze, the fact that it has to be scrolled) fails to effectively compete with the printed page. The latter is still the most ingenious medium yet invented for the storage and release of textual information. Granted: a computer screen is better at highlightin
g discrete units of information. So, this draws the batlle lines: structures (printed pages) versus units (screen), the continuous and easily reversible versus the discrete. 
\par The solution is an efficient way to translate computer screens to printed matter. 
It is hard to believe, but no such thing exists. Computer screens are still hostile to off-line printing. In other words: if a user copies information from the Internet to his Word Processor (or vice versa, for that matter) - he ends up with a fragmented,
 garbage-filled and non-aesthetic document. 
\par Very few site developers try to do something about it - even fewer succeed. 
\par }{\b 3. The Internet and the CD-ROM}{
\par One of the biggest mistakes of content suppliers is that they do not mix contents or have a "static-dynamic interaction". 
\par The Internet can now easily interact with other media (especially with audio CDs and with CD-ROMs) - even as the user surfs. 
\par Examples abound: 
\par A shopping catalogue can be distributed on a CD-ROM by mail. The Internet Site will allow the
 user to order a product previously selected from the catalogue, while off-line. The catalogue could also be updated through the site (as is done with CD-ROM encyclopedias). 
\par The advantages of the CD-ROM are clear: very fast access time (dozens of times faster than the access to a site using a dial up connection) and a data storage capacity tens of times bigger than the average website. 
\par Another example: a CD-ROM can be distributed, containing hundreds of advertisements. The consumer will select the ad that he wants to see and will connect to the Internet to view a relevant video. 
\par He could then also have an interactive chat (or a conference) with a salesperson, receive information about the company, about the ad, about the advertising agency which created the ad - and so on. 
\par CD-ROM based encyclopedias (such as the Britannica, Encarta, Grolier) already contain hyperlinks which carry the user to sites selected by an Editorial Board. 
\par But CD-ROMs are probably a doomed medium. This industry chose to emphasize t
he wrong things. Storage capacity increased exponentially and, within a year, desktops with 80 Gb hard disks will be common. Moreover, the Network Computer - the stripped down version of the personal computer - will put at the disposal of the average user
 
terabytes in storage capacity and the processing power of a supercomputer. What separates computer users from this utopia is the communication bandwidth. With the introduction of radio, statellite, ADSL broadband services, cable modems and compression met
hods - video (on demand), audio and data will be available speedily and plentifully. 
\par The CD-ROM, on the other hand, is not mobile. It requires installation and the utilization of sophisticated hardware and software. This is no user friendly push technology
. It is nerd-oriented. As a result, CD-ROMs are not an immediate medium. There is a long time lapse between the moment they are purchased and the moment the first data become accessible to the user. Compare this to a book or a magazine. Data in these olde
st of media is instantly available to the user and allows for easy and accurate "back" and "forward" functions. 
\par Perhaps the biggest mistake of CD-ROM manufacturers has been their inability to offer an integrated hardware and software package. CD-ROMs are n
ot compact. A Walkman is a compact hardware-cum-software package. It is easily transportable, it is thin, it contains numerous, user-friendly, sophisticated functions, it provides immediate access to data. So does the discman or the MP3-man. This cannot b
e
 said of the CD-ROM. By tying its future to the obsolete concept of stand-alone, expensive, inefficient and technologically unreliable personal computers - CD-ROMs have sentenced themselves to oblivion (with the possible exception of reference material). 

\par }{\b 4. On-line Reference Libraries}{
\par These already exist. A visit to the on-line Encyclopaedia Britannica exemplifies some of the tremendous, mind boggling possibilities: 
\par Each entry is hyperlinked to sites on the Internet which deal with the same subject matter
. The sites are carefully screened (though more detailed descriptions of each site should be available - they could be prepared either by the staff of the encyclopaedia or by the site owner). Links are available to data in various forms, including audio a
nd video. Everything can be copied to the hard disk or to CD-ROMs. 
\par This is a new conception of a knowledge centre - not just an assortment of material. It is modular, can be added on and subtracted from. It can be linked to a voice Q&A centre. Queries by s
ubscribers can be answered by e-mail, by fax, posted on the site, hard copies can be sent by post. This "Trivial Pursuit" service could be very popular - there is considerable appetite for "Just in Time Information". The Library of Congress - together wit
h a few other libraries - is in the process of making just such a service available to the public (CDRS - Collaborative Digital Reference Service). 
\par }{\b 5. The Feedback Option}{
\par Hard to believe, but very few sites encourage their guests to express an opinion abou
t the site, its contents and its aesthetics. This indicates an ossified mode of thinking about the most dynamic mass medium ever created, the only interactive mass medium yet. Each site must absolutely contain feedback and rating questionnaires. It has th
e side benefit of creating a database of the visitors to the site. 
\par Moreover, each site can easily become a "knowledge centre". 
\par Let us consider a site dedicated to advertising and marketing: 
\par It can contain feedback questionnaires (what do you think about the site, suggestions for improvement, mailto and leave message facilities, etc.) 
\par It can contain rating questionnaires (rate these ads, these TV or radio shows, these advertising campaigns). 
\par It can allocate some space to clients to create their home pages in (these home pages could lead to their sites, to other sites, to other sections of the host site - and, in any case, will serve as a display of the creative talent of the site owners). Thi
s will give the site owners a picture of the distribution of the areas of interest of the visitors to the site. 
\par The site can include statistical, tracking and counter software. 
\par Such a site can refer to hundreds of useful shareware applications (which dea
l with different aspects of advertising and marketing, for instance). Developers of applications will be able to use the site to promote their products. Other practical applications could also be referred to from - or reside on - the site (browsers, games
, search engines). 
\par And all this can be organized in a portal structure (for instance, by adopting the open software of the Open Directory Project).
\par }{\b 6. Internet Derived CD-ROMS}{
\par The Internet is an enormous reservoir of freely available, public domain, information. 
\par With a minimal investment, this information can be gathered into coherent, theme oriented, cheap CD-ROMs. Each such CD-ROM can contain:

\par The Internet is the world's largest "publisher", by far. It "publishes
" FAQs (Frequent Answers and Questions regarding almost every technical matter in the world), e-zines (electronic versions of magazines, not a very profitable pursuit), the electronic versions of dailies (together with on-line news and information service
s), reference and other e-books, monographs, articles and minutes of discussions ("threads"), among other types of material. 
\par Publishing an e-zine has a few advantages: it promotes the sales of the printed edition, it helps to sign on subscribers and it lea
ds to the sale of advertising space. The electronic archive function (see next section) saves the need to file back issues, the space required to do so and the irritating search for data items. 
\par The future trend is a combined subscription: electronic (mainly for the archival value and the ability to hyperlink to additional information) and printed (easier to browse current issue). 
\par The electronic daily presents other advantages: 
\par It allows for immediate feedback and for flowing, almost real-time, communicat
ion between writers and readers. The electronic version, therefore, acquires a gyroscopic function: a navigation instrument, always indicating deviations from the "right" course. The content can be instantly updated and immediacy has its premium (remember
 the Lewinsky affair?). 
\par Strangely, this (conventional) field was the first to develop a "virtual reality" facet. There are virtual "magazine stalls". They look exactly like the real thing and the user can buy a paper using his mouse. 
\par Specialty hand held d
evices already allow for downloading and storage of vast quantities of data (up to 4000 print pages). The user gains access to libraries containing hundreds of texts, adapted to be downloaded, stored and read by the specific device. Again, a convergence o
f standards is to be expected in this field as well (the final contenders will probably be Adobe's PDF against Microsoft's MS-Reader). 
\par Broadly, e-books are treated either as: 
\par Continuation of print books (p-books) by other means \line or as \line A whole new publishing universe. 
\par Since p-books are a more convenient medium then e-books - they will prevail in any straightforward "medium replacement" or "medium displacement" battle. 
\par In other words, if publishers will persist in the simple and straightforward conversion of p-books to e-books - then e-books are doomed. They are simply inferior to the price, comfort, tactile delights, browseability and scanability of p-books. 
\par But e-books - being digital - open up a vista of hitherto neglected possibilities. These will only be enhanced and enriched by the introduction of e-paper and e-ink. Among them:

The technology is still not fully there. Wars rage in both the wireless and the ebook realms. Platforms compete. Standards clash. Gurus debate. But convergence is inevitable and with it the e-book of the future. 
\par }{\b 8. The Archive Function}{
\par The Internet is also the world's biggest cemetery: tens of thousands of deadbeat sites, still accessible - the "Ghost Sites" of this electronic frontier. 
\par This, in a way, 
is collective memory. One of the Internet's main functions will be to preserve and transfer knowledge through time. It is called "memory" in biology - and "archive" in library science. The history of the Internet is being documented by search engines (Goo
gle) and specialized services (Alexa) alike.

\par }\pard \s18\ql \li0\ri0\sb100\sa100\sbauto1\saauto1\widctlpar\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0\itap0 {\~\line Drawing a comparison from the development of a human baby - the human race has just commenced to develop its neural system. 
\par The Internet fulfils all the functions of the N
ervous System in the body and is, both functionally and structurally, pretty similar. It is decentralized, redundant (each part can serve as functional backup in case of malfunction). It hosts information which is accessible in a few ways, it contains a m
emory function, it is multimodal (multimedia - textual, visual, audio and animation). 
\par I believe that the comparison is not superficial and that studying the functions of the brain (from infancy to adulthood) - amounts to perusing the future of the Net itself. 
\par }{\b 1. The Collective Computer}{
\par To carry the metaphor of "a collective brain" further, we would expect the processing of information to take place in the Internet, rather than inside the end-user\rquote s hardware (the same way that information is processed in th
e brain, not in the eyes). Desktops will receive the results and communicate with the Net to receive additional clarifications and instructions and to convey information gathered from their environment (mostly, from the user). 
\par This is part fo the philosophy of the JAVA programming language. It deals with applets - small bits of software - and links different computer platforms by means of software. 
\par Put differently: 
\par Future servers will contain not only information (as they do today) - but also software ap
plications. The user of an application will not be forced to buy it. He will not be driven into hardware-related expenditures to accommodate the ever growing size of applications. He will not find himself wasting his scarce memory and computing resources 
o
n passive storage. Instead, he will use a browser to call a central computer. This computer will contain the needed software, broken to its elements (=applets, small applications). Anytime the user wishes to use one of the functions of the application, he
 
will siphon it off the central computer. When finished - he will "return" it. Processing speeds and response times will be such that the user will not feel at all that it is not with his own software that he is working (the question of ownership will be v
e
ry blurred in such a world). This technology is available and it provoked a heated debated about the future shape of the computing industry as a whole (desktops - really power packs - or network computers, a little more than dumb terminals). Applications 
are already offered to corporate users by ASPs (Application Service Providers). 
\par In the last few years, scientists put the combined power of the computers linked to the internet at any given moment to perform astounding feats of distributed parallel process
ing. Millions of PCs connected to the net co-process signals from outer space, meteorological data and solve complex equations. This is a prime example of a collective brain in action. 
\par }{\b 2. The Intranet - a Logical Extension of the Collective Computer}{
\par LANs (Local Area Networks) are no longer a rarity in corporate offices. WANs (wide Area Networks) are used to connect geographically dispersed organs of the same legal entity (branches of a bank, daughter companies, a sales force). Many LANs are wireless.
 
\par The intranet / extranet and wireless LANs will be the winners. They will gradually eliminate both fixed line LANs and WANs. The Internet offers equal, platform-independent, location-independent and time of day - independent access to all the members of an
 organization.Sophisticated firewall security application protects the privacy and confidentiality of the intranet from all but the most determined and savvy hackers. 
\par The Intranet is an inter-organizational communication network, constructed on the platform of the Internet and which enjoys all its advantages. The extranet is open to clients and suppliers as well. 
\par The company's server can be accessed by anyone authorized, from anywhere, at any time (with local - rather than international - communication co
sts). The user can leave messages (internal e-mail or v-mail), access information - proprietary or public - from it and to participate in "virtual teamwork" (see next chapter). 
\par By the year 2002, a standard intranet interface will emerge. This will be faci
litated by the opening up of the TCP/IP communication architecture and its availability to PCs. A billion USD will go just to finance intranet servers - or, at least, this is the median forecast. 
\par The development of measures to safeguard server routed inte
r-organizational communication (firewalls) is the solution to one of two obstacles to the institution of the Intranet. The second problem is the limited bandwidth which does not permit the efficient transfer of audio (not to mention video). 
\par It is difficult to conduct video conferencing through the Internet. Even the voices of discussants who use internet phones come out (slightly) distorted. 
\par All this did not prevent 95% of the Fortune 1000 from installing intranet. 82% of the rest intend to install one by the end of this year. Medium to big size American firms have 50-100 intranet terminals per every internet one. 
\par At the end of 1997, there were 10 web servers per every other type of server in organizations. The sale of intranet related software was projected to multiply by 16 (to 8 billion USD) by the year 1999. 
\par One of the greatest advantages of the intranet is the ability to transfer documents between the various parts of an organization. Consider Visa: it pushed 2 million documents per day internally in 1996. 
\par An organization equipped with an intranet can (while protected by firewalls) give its clients or suppliers access to non-classified correspondence. This notion has its\~ charm. Consider a newspaper: it can give access to all the materials which were
 discarded by the editors. Some news are fit to print - yet are discarded because of\~
 space limitations. Still, someone is bound to be interested. It costs the newspaper close to nothing (the material is, normally, already computer-resident) - and it might
 even generate added circulation and income. It can be even conceived as an "underground, non-commercial, alternative" newspaper for a wholly different readership. 
\par The above is but one example of the possible use of the intranet to communicate with the organization\rquote s consumer base. 
\par }{\b 3. Mail and Chat}{
\par The Internet (its e-mail possibilities) is eroding traditional mail. The market share of the post office in conveying messages by regular mail has dwindled from 77% to 62% (1995). E-mail has expanded to capture 36% (up from 19%). 
\par 90% of customers with on-line access use e-mail from time to time and 60% work with it regularly. More than 2 billion messages traverse the internet daily. 
\par E-mail applications are available as freeware and are included in all browsers
. Thus, the Internet has completely assimilated what used to be a separate service, to the extent that many people make the mistake of thinking that e-mail is a feature of the Internet. Microsoft continues to incorporate previously independent application
s in its browsers - a behaviour which led to the 1999 anti-trust lawsuit against it. 
\par The internet will do to phone calls what it has done to mail. Already there are applications (Intel\rquote s, Vocaltec\rquote s, Net2Phone) which enable the user to conduct a phone conv
ersation through his computer. The voice quality has improved. The discussants can cut into each others words, argue and listen to tonal nuances. Today, the parties (two or more) engaging in the conversation must possess the same software and the same (co
m
puter) hardware. In the very near future, computer-to-regular phone applications will eliminate this requirement. And, again, simultaneous multi-modality: the user can talk over the phone, see his party, send e-mail, receive messages and transfer document
s - without obstructing the flow of the conversation. 
\par The cost of transferring voice will become so negligible that free voice traffic is conceivable in 3-5 years. Data traffic will overtake voice traffic by a wide margin. 
\par This beats regular phones. 
\par The 
next phase will probably involve virtual reality. Each of the parties will be represented by an "avatar", a 3-D figurine generated by the application (or the user's likeness mapped into the software and superimposed on the the avatar). These figurines wil
l be multi-dimensional: they will possess their own communication patterns, special habits, history, preferences - in short: their own "personality". 
\par Thus, they will be able to maintain an "identity" and a consistent pattern of communication which they will develop over time. 
\par Such a figure could host a site, accept, welcome and guide visitors, all the time bearing their preferences in its electronic "mind". It could narrate the news, like "Ananova" does. Visiting sites in the future is bound to be a much more pleasant affair. 

\par }{\b 4. E-cash}{
\par In 1996, the four corporate giants (Visa, MasterCard, Netscape and Microsoft) agreed on a standard for effecting secure payments through the Internet: SET. Internet commerce is supposed to mushroom by a factor of 50 to 25 bi
llion USD. Site owners will be able to collect rent from passing visitors - or fees for services provided within the site. Amazon instituted an honour system to collect donations from visitors. Dedicated visitors will not be deterred by such trifles. 

\par }{\b 5. The Virtual Organization}{
\par The Internet allows simultaneous communication between an almost unlimited number of users. This is coupled with the efficient transfer of multimedia (video included) files. 
\par This opens up a vista of mind boggling opportunities which are the real core of the Internet revolution: the virtual collaborative ("Follow the Sun") modes. 
\par Examples: 
\par A group of musicians will be able to compose music or play it - while spatially and temporally separated; 
\par Advertising agencies will be able to co-produce ad campaigns in a real time interactive mode; 
\par Cinema and TV films will be produced from disparate geographical spots through the teamwork of people who never meet, except through the net. 
\par These examples ill
ustrate the concept of the "virtual community". Locations in space and time will no longer hinder a collaboration in a team: be it scientific, artistic, cultural, or for the provision of services (a virtual law firm or accounting office, a virtual consult
ancy network). 
\par Two on going developments are the virtual mall and the virtual catalogue. 
\par There are well over 300 active virtual malls in the Internet. They were frequented by 32.5 million shoppers, who shopped in them for goods and services in 1998. The intranet can also be thought of as a "virtual organization", or a "virtual business". 

\par The virtual mall is a computer "space" (pages) in the internet, wherein "shops" are located. These shops offer their wares using visual, audio and textual means. The visi
tor passes a gate into the store and looks through its offering, until he reaches a buying decision. Then he engages in a feedback process: he pays (with a credit card), buys the product and waits for it to arrive by mail. The manufacturers of digital pro
ducts (intellectual property such as e-books or software) have begun selling their merchandise on-line, as file downloads. 
\par Yet, slow communications and limited bandwidth - constrain the growth potential of this mode of sale. Once solved - intellectual prop
erty will be sold directly from the net, on-line. Until such time, the intervention of the Post Office is still required. So, then virtual mall is nothing but a glorified computerized mail catalogue or Buying Channel, the only difference being the excepti
onally varied inventory. 
\par Websites which started as "specialty stores" are fast transforming themselves into multi-purpose virtual malls. Amazon.com, for instance, has bought into a virtual pharmacy and into other virtual businesses. It is now selling music
, video, electronics and many other products. It started as a bookstore. 
\par This contrasts with a much more creative idea: the virtual catalogue. It is a form of narrowcasting (as opposed to broadcasting): a surgically accurate targeting of potential consume
r audiences. Each group of profiled consumers (no matter how small) is fitted with their own - digitally generated - catalogue. This is updated daily: the variety of wares on offer (adjusted to reflect inventory levels, consumer preferences and goods in t
ransit) - and prices (sales, discounts, package deals) change in real time. 
\par The user will enter the site and there delineate his consumption profile and his preferences. A customized catalogue will be immediately generated for him. 
\par From then on, the history of his purchases, preferences and responses to feedback questionnaires will be accumulated and added to a database. 
\par Each catalogue generated for him will come replete with order forms. Once the user concluded his purchases, his profile will be updated. 
\par There is no technological obstacles to implementing this vision today - only administrative and legal ones. Big retail stores are not up to processing the flood of data expected to arrive. They also remain highly sceptical regarding the feasibility of th
e new medium. And privacy issues prevent data mining or the effective collection and usage of personal data. 
\par The virtual catalogue is a private case of a new internet off-shoot: the "smart (shopping) agents". These are AI applications with "long memories". 
\par They draw detailed profiles of consumers and users and then suggest purchases and refer to the appropriate sites, catalogues, or virtual malls. 
\par They also provide price comparisons and the new generation (NetBot) cannot be blocked or fooled by using differing product categories. 
\par In the future, these agents will refer also to real life retail chains and issue a map of the branch or store closest to an address specified by the user (the default being his residence). This technology can be seen in action i
n a few music sites on the web and is likely to be dominant with wireless internet appliances. The owner of an internet enabled (third generation) mobile phone is likely to be the target of geographically-specific marketing campaigns, ads and special offe
rs pertaining to his current location (as reported by his GPS - satellite Geographic Positioning System). 
\par }{\b 6. Internet News}{
\par Internet news are advantaged. They can be frequently and dynamically updated (unlike static print news) and be always accessible (similar to print news), immediate and fresh. 
\par The future will witness a form of interactive news. A special "corner" in the site will be open to updates posted by the public (the equivalent of press releases). This will provide readers with a glimpse into the
 making of the news, the raw material news are made of. The same technology will be applied to interactive TVs. Content will be downloaded from the internet and be displayed as an overlay on the TV screen or in a square in a special location. The contents
 downloaded will be directly connected to the TV programming. Thus, the biography and track record of a football player will be displayed during a football match and the history of a country when it gets news coveage.

This is an unconventional way to look at the Internet. Laymen and experts alike talk about "sites" and "advertising space". Yet, the Internet was never compared to a new continent whose surface is infinite. 
\par The Internet will have its own
 real estate developers and construction companies. The real life equivalents derive their profits from the scarcity of the resource that they exploit - the Internet counterparts will derive their profits from the tenants (the content). 
\par Two examples: 
\par A few companies bought "Internet Space" (pages, domain names, portals), developed it and make commercial use of it by:

Internet Space can be easily purchased or created. The investment is low and getting lower with the introduction of competition in the field of domain registration services and the increase in the number of top domains. 
\par Then, infrastructure can be erected - for a shopping mall, for free home pages, for a portal, or for another purpose. It is precisely this infrastructure that the developer can later sell, lease, franchise, or rent out. 
\par At the beginning, only members of the fringes and the avant-garde (inventors, risk assuming entrepreneurs, gamblers) invest in a new invention. The invention of a new communications technology is mostly accompanied by devastating silence. 
\par No one knows 
to say what are the optimal uses of the invention (in other words, what is its future). Many - mostly members of the scientific and business elites - argue that there is no real need for the invention and that it substitutes a new and untried way for old 
and tried modes of doing the same thing (so why assume the risk?) 
\par These criticisms are usually founded: 
\par To start with, there is, indeed, no need for the new medium. A new medium invents itself - and the need for it. It also generates its own market to satisfy this newly found need. 
\par Two prime examples are the personal computer and the compact disc. 
\par When the PC was invented, its uses were completely unclear. Its performance was lacking, its abilities limited, it was horribly user unfriendly. 
\par It suffered from faulty design, absent user comfort and ease of use and required considerable professional knowledge to operate. The worst part was that this knowledge was unique to the new invention (not portable). 
\par It reduced labour mobility and limited one's professional horizons. There were many gripes among those assigned to tame the new beast. 
\par The PC was thought of, at the beginning, as a sophisticated gaming machine, an electronic baby-sitter. As the presence of a keyboard was detected and as the professional ho
rizon cleared it was thought of in terms of a glorified typewriter or spreadsheet. It was used mainly as a word processor (and its existence justified solely on these grounds). The spreadsheet was the first real application and it demonstrated the advanta
g
es inherent to this new machine (mainly flexibility and speed). Still, it was more (speed) of the same. A quicker ruler or pen and paper. What was the difference between this and a hand held calculator (some of them already had computing, memory and progr
amming features)? 
\par The PC was recognized as a medium only 30 years after it was invented with the introduction of multimedia software. All this time, the computer continued to spin off markets and secondary markets, needs and professional specialities. The 
talk as always was centred on how to improve on }{\ul existing }{markets and solutions. 
\par The Internet is the computer\rquote s first important breakthrough. Hitherto the computer was only quantitatively different - the multimedia and the Internet have made it qualitatively superior, actually, sui generis, unique. 
\par This, precisely, is the ghost haunting the Internet: 
\par It has been invented, is maintained and is operated by computer professionals. For decades these people have been conditioned to think in Olympic terms: more
, stronger, higher. Not: new, unprecedented, non-existent. To improve - not to invent. They stumbled across the Internet - it invented itself despite its own creators. 
\par Computer professionals (hardware and software experts alike) - are linear thinkers. The Internet is non linear and modular. 
\par It is still the age of hackers. There is still a lot to be done in improving technological prowess and powers. But their control of the contents is waning and they are being gradually replaced by communicators, creativ
e people, advertising executives, psychologists and the totally unpredictable masses who flock to flaunt their home pages. 
\par These all are attuned to the user, his mental needs and his information and entertainment preferences. 
\par The compact disc is a different tale. It was intentionally invented to improve upon an existing technology (basically, Edison\rquote 
s Gramophone). Market-wise, this was a major gamble: the improvement was, at first, debatable (many said that the sound quality of the first generation of com
pact discs was inferior to that of its contemporaneous record players). Consumers had to be convinced to change both software and hardware and to dish out thousands of dollars just to listen to what the manufacturers claimed was better quality Bach. A bet
ter argument was the longer life of the software (though contrasted with the limited life expectancy of the consumer, some of the first sales pitches sounded absolutely morbid). 
\par The computer suffered from unclear positioning. The compact disc was very clear as to its main functions - but had a rough time convincing the consumers. 
\par Every medium is first controlled by the technical people. Gutenberg was a printer - not a publisher. Yet, he is the world's most famous publisher. The technical cadre is joined by
 dubious or small-scale entrepreneurs and, together, they establish ventures with no clear vision, market-oriented thinking, or orderly plan of action. The legislator is also dumbfounded and does not grasp what is happening - thus, there is no legislation
 
to regulate the use of the medium. Witness the initial confusion concerning copyrighted software and the copyrights of ROM embedded software. Abuse or under-utilization of resources grow. Recall the sale of radio frequencies to the first cellular phone op
erators in the West - a situation which repeats itself in Eastern and Central Europe nowadays. 
\par But then more complex transactions - exactly as in real estate in "real life" - begin to emerge. 
\par This distinction is important. While in real life it is possible to sell an undeveloped plot of land - no one will buy "pages". The supply of these is unlimited - their scarcity (and, therefore, their virtual price) is zero. 
\par The second example involves the utilization of a site - rather than its mere availability. 
\par A developer could open a site wherein first time authors will be able to publish their first manuscript - for a fee. Evidently, such a fee will be a fraction of what it would take to publish a "real life" book. The author could collect money for any downl
o
ading of his book - and split it with the site developer. The potential buyers will be provided with access to the contents and to a chapter of the books. This is currently being done by a few fledgling firms but a full scale publishing industry has not y
et developed.

The internet is simply the latest in a series of networks which revolutionized our lives. A century before the internet, the telegraph, the railways, the radio and the telephone have been similarly heralded as "global" and transforming. 
\par Every medium of communications goes through the same evolutionary cycle: 
\par }{\b Anarchy}{ 
\par }{\b\i The Public Phase}{ 
\par At this stage, the medium and the resources attached to it are very cheap, accessible, under no regulatory constraints. The public se
ctor steps in: higher education institutions, religious institutions, government, not for profit organizations, non governmental organizations (NGOs), trade unions, etc. Bedevilled by limited financial resources, they regard the new medium as a cost effec
tive way of disseminating their messages. 
\par The Internet was not exempt from this phase which ended only a few years ago. It started with a complete computer anarchy manifested in ad hoc networks, local networks, networks of organizations (mainly universitie
s and organs of the government such as DARPA, a part of the defence establishment, in the USA). Non commercial entities jumped on the bandwagon and started sewing these networks together (an activity fully subsidized by government funds). The result was a
 
globe encompassing network of academic institutions. The American Pentagon established the network of all networks, the ARPANET. Other government departments joined the fray, headed by the National Science Foundation (NSF) which withdrew only lately from 
the Internet. 
\par The Internet (with a different name) became semi-public property - with access granted to the chosen few. 
\par Radio took precisely this course. Radio transmissions started in the USA in 1920. Those were anarchic broadcasts with no discernible re
gularity. Non commercial organizations and not for profit organizations began their own broadcasts and even created radio broadcasting infrastructure (albeit of the cheap and local kind) dedicated to their audiences. Trade unions, certain educational inst
itutions and religious groups commenced "public radio" broadcasts. 
\par }{\b\i The Commercial Phase}{ 
\par When the users (e.g., listeners in the case of the radio, or owners of PCs and modems in the example of the Internet) reach a critical mass - the business sector is al
erted. In the name of capitalist ideology (another religion, really) it demands "privatization" of the medium. This harps on very sensitive strings in every Western soul: the efficient allocation of resources which is the result of competition, corruption
 and inefficiency naturally associated with the public sector ("Other People\rquote 
s Money" - OPM), the ulterior motives of members of the ruling political echelons (the infamous American Paranoia), a lack of variety and of catering to the tastes and interests of certain audiences, the equation private enterprise = democracy and more. 

\par The end result is the same: the private sector takes over the medium from "below" (makes offers to the owners or operators of the medium - that they cannot possibly refuse) - or fro
m "above" (successful lobbying in the corridors of power leads to the appropriate legislation and the medium is "privatized"). 
\par Every privatization - especially that of a medium - provokes public opposition. There are (usually founded) suspicions that the 
interests of the public were compromised and sacrificed on the altar of commercialization and rating. Fears of monopolization and cartelization of the medium are evoked - and justified, in due time. Otherwise, there is fear of the concentration of control
 of the medium in a few hands. All these things do happen - but the pace is so slow that the initial fears are forgotten and public attention reverts to fresher issues. 
\par A new Communications Act was legislated in the USA in 1934. It was meant to transform r
adio frequencies into a national resource to be sold to the private sector which will use it to transmit radio signals to receivers. In other words: the radio was passed on to private and commercial hands. Public radio was doomed to be marginalized. 

\par The American administration withdrew from its last major involvement in the Internet in April 1995, when the NSF ceased to finance some of the networks and, thus, privatized its hitherto heavy involvement in the net. 
\par A new Communications Act was legislated in 1996. It permitted "organized anarchy". It allowed media operators to invade each other\rquote s territories. 
\par Phone companies will be allowed to transmit video and cable companies will be allowed to transmit telephony, for instance. This is all phased over a lon
g period of time - still, it is a revolution whose magnitude is difficult to gauge and whose consequences defy imagination. It carries an equally momentous price tag - official censorship. "Voluntary censorship", to be sure, somewhat toothless standardiza
t
ion and enforcement authorities, to be sure - still, a censorship with its own institutions to boot. The private sector reacted by threatening litigation - but, beneath the surface it is caving in to pressure and temptation, constructing its own censorshi
p codes both in the cable and in the internet media. 
\par }{\b\i Institutionalization}{ 
\par This phase is the next in the Internet's history, though, it seems, unbeknownst to it. 
\par It is characterized by enhanced activities of legislation. Legislators, on all levels, discov
er the medium and lurch at it passionately. Resources which were considered "free", suddenly are transformed to "national treasures not to be dispensed with cheaply, casually and with frivolity". 
\par It is conceivable that certain parts of the Internet will b
e "nationalized" (for instance, in the form of a licensing requirement) and tendered to the private sector. Legislation will be enacted which will deal with permitted and disallowed content (obscenity? incitement? racial or gender bias?) 
\par No medium in the 
USA (not to mention the wide world) has eschewed such legislation. There are sure to be demands to allocate time (or space, or software, or content, or hardware) to "minorities", to "public affairs", to "community business". This is a tax that the busines
s sector will have to pay to fend off the eager legislator and his nuisance value. 
\par All this is bound to lead to a monopolization of hosts and servers. The important broadcast channels will diminish in number and be subjected to severe content restrictions.
 Sites which will not succumb to these requirements - will be deleted or neutralized. Content guidelines (euphemism for censorship) exist, even as we write, in all major content providers (CompuServe, AOL, Geocities, Tripod, Prodigy). 
\par }{\b\i The Bloodbath}{ 
\par This 
is the phase of consolidation. The number of players is severely reduced. The number of browser types will be limited to 2-3 (Netscape, Microsoft and which else?). Networks will merge to form privately owned mega-networks. Servers will merge to form hyper
-servers run on supercomputers in "server farms". The number of ISPs will be considerably cut. 
\par 50 companies ruled the greater part of the media markets in the USA in 1983. The number in 1995 was 18. At the end of the century they will number 6. 
\par This is th
e stage when companies - fighting for financial survival - strive to acquire as many users/listeners/viewers as possible. The programming is shallowed to the lowest (and widest) common denominator. Shallow programming dominates as long as the bloodbath pr
oceeds. 
\par }{\b\i From Rags to Riches}{ 
\par Tough competition produces four processes: 
\par }{\b 1. A Major Drop in Hardware Prices}{
\par This happens in every medium but it doubly applies to a computer-dependent medium, such as the Internet. 
\par Computer technology seems to abide by "Moore\rquote 
s Law" which says that the number of transistors which can be put on a chip doubles itself every 18 months. As a result of this miniaturization, computing power quadruples every 18 months and an exponential seri
es ensues. Organic-biological-DNA computers, quantum computers, chaos computers - prompted by vast profits and spawned by inventive genius will ensure the longevity and continued applicability of Moore's Law. 
\par The Internet is also subject to "Metcalf\rquote s Law". 
\par It says that when we connect N computers to a network - we get an increase of N to the second power in its computing / processing power. And these N computers are more powerful every year, according to Moore\rquote s Law. 
\par The growth of computing powers in networks is a multiple of the effects of the two laws. More and more computers with ever increasing computing power get connected and create an exponential 16 times growth in the network\rquote 
s computing power every 18 months. 
\par }{\b 2. Free Availability of Software and Connection}{
\par This is prevalent in the Net where even potentially commercial software can be downloaded for free. In many countries television viewers still pay for television broadcasts - but in the USA and many other countries in the West, the basic packa
ge of television channels comes free of charge. 
\par As users / consumers form a habit of using (or consuming) the software - it is commercialized and begins to carry a price tag. This is what happened with the advent of cable television: contents are sold for
 subscription and usage (Pay Per View - PPV) fees. 
\par Gradually, this is what will happen to most of the sites and software on the Net. Those which survive will begin to collect usage fees, access fees, subscription fees, downloading fees and other, appropri
ately named, fees. These fees are bound to be low - but it is the principle that counts. Even a few cents per transaction will accumulate to hefty sums with the traffic which will characterize the Net (or, at least its more popular locales). 
\par Adverising re
venues will allow ISPs to offer free communication and storage volume. Gradually, connect time charges imposed by the phone companies will be eroded by tough competition from the likes of the cable companies. Accessing the internet might well be free of a
ll charges in 10 years time. 
\par }{\b 3. Increased User Friendliness}{
\par As long as the computer is less user friendly and less reliable (predictable) than television - less of a black box - its potential (and its future) is limited. Television attracts 3.5 billion use
rs daily. The Internet will attract - under the most exuberant scenario - less than one tenth of this number of people. The only reasons for this disparity are (the lack of) user friendliness and reliability. Even browsers, among the most user friendly ap
plications ever - are not sufficiently so. The user still needs to know how to use a keyboard and must possess some basic acquaintance with the operating system. 
\par The more mature the medium, the more friendly it becomes. Finally, it will be operated using speech or common language. There will be room left for user "hunches" and built in flexible responses. 
\par }{\b 4. Social Taxes}{
\par Sooner or later, the business sector has to mollify the God of public opinion by offerings of political and social nature. The Internet i
s an affluent, educated, yuppie medium. It necessitates a control of the English language, live interest in information and its various uses (scientific, commercial, other), a lot of resources (free time, money to invest in hardware, software and connect 
time). It empowers - and thus deepens the divide between the haves and have-nots, the knowing and the ignorant, the computer illiterate. 
\par In short: the Internet is an elitist medium. Publicly, this is an unhealthy posture. "Internetophobia" is already disce
rnible. People (and politicians) talk about how unsafe the Internet is and about its possible uses for racial, sexist and pornographic purposes. The wider public is in a state of awe. 
\par So, site builders and owners will do well to begin to improve their ima
ge: provide free access to schools and community centres, bankroll internet literacy classes, freely distribute contents and software to educational institutions, collaborate with researchers and social scientists and engineers. 
\par In short: encourage the vi
ew that the Internet is a medium catering to the needs of the community and the underprivileged, a mostly altruist endeavour. This also happens to make good business sense by educating a future generation of users. He who visited a site when a student, fr
ee of charge - will pay to do so when made an executive. Such a user will also pass on the information within and without his organization. This is called media exposure. 
\par The future will, no doubt, witness public Internet terminals, subsidized ISP accounts, free Internet classes and an alternative "non-commercial, public" approach to the Net.

ications specifications - are all unique. 
\par }{\b\i No Government}{ 
\par The Internet has no central (or even decentralized) structure. In reality, it hardly has a structure at all. It is a collection of 16 million computers (end 1996) connected through thousands of netw
orks. There are organizations which purport to set Internet standards (like the aforementioned ISOC, or the domain setting ICANN) - but they are all voluntary organizations, with no binding legal, enforcement, or adjudication powers. The result is often m
ayhem. 
\par Many erroneously call the Internet the first democratic medium. Yet, it hardly qualifies as a medium and by no stretch of terminology is it democratic. Democracy has institutions, hierarchies, order. The Internet has none of these things. There are 
some vague understandings as to what is and is not allowed. This is a "code of honour" (more reminiscent of the Sicilian Mob than of the British Parliament, let\rquote s say). Violations are punished by excommunication (of the violating site or person). 

\par The Inte
rnet has culture - but no education. Freedom of Speech is entrenched. Members of this virtual community react adversely to ideas of censorship, even when applied to hard core porno. In 1999, hackers hacked major government sites following an FBI initiativ
e against hacking-related crimes. Government initiatives (in the USA, in France, the lawsuit against the General Manager of AOL in Germany) are acutely criticized. In the meantime, the spirit of the Internet prevails: the small man\rquote 
s medium. What seems to be emerging, though, is self censorship by content providers (such as AOL and CompuServe). 
\par }{\b\i Independence}{ 
\par The Internet is not dependent upon a given hardware or software. True, it is accessible only through computers and there are dominant browsers. 
\par But the Internet accommodates any digital (bit transfer) platform. Internet will be incorporated in the future into portable computers, palmtops, PDAs, mobile phones, cable television, telephones (with voice interface), home appliances and even wrist watc
hes. It will be accessible to all, regardless of hardware and software. 
\par The situation is, obviously, different with other media. There is standard hardware (the television set, the radio receiver, the digital print equipment). Data transfer modes are stand
ardized as well. The only variable is the contents - and even this is standardized in an age of American cultural imperialism. Today, one can see the same television programs all over the globe, regardless of cultural or geographical differences. 
\par Here is a reasonable prognosis for the Internet: 
\par It will "broadcast" (it is, of course, a PULL medium, not a PUSH medium - see next chapter) to many kinds of hardware. Its functions will be controlled by 2-5 very common software applications. But it will differ f
rom television in that contents will continue to be decentralized: every point on the Net is a potential producer of content at low cost. This is the equivalent of producing a talk show using a single home video camera. And the contents will remain varied
. 
\par Naturally, marketing content (sites) will remain an expensive art. Sites will also be richer or poorer, in accordance with the investment made in them. 
\par }{\b\i Non Linearity and Functional Modularity}{ 
\par The Internet is the first medium in human history that is non-linear and totally modular. 
\par A television program is broadcast from a transmitter, through the airwaves to a receiver (=the television set). The viewer sits opposite this receiver and passively watches. This is an entirely linear process. The Internet is different: 
\par When communicating through the Internet, there is no way to predict how the information will reach its destination. The routing of information through the network is completely random, very much like the principle governing the telephony syste
m (but on a global scale). The latter is not a point-to-point linear network. Rather, it is a network of networks. Our voice is transmitted back and forth inside a gigantic maze of copper wires and optic fibres. It seeps through any available wire - until
 it reaches its destination. 
\par It is the same with the Internet. 
\par Information is divided to packets. An address is attached to each packet and - using the TCP/IP data transfer protocol - is dispatched to roam this worldwide labyrinth. But the path from one neighbourhood of London to another may traverse Japan. 
\par The really ingenious thing about the Internet is that each computer (each receiver or end user) indeed burdens the system by imposing on it its information needs (as is the case with other media) - but
 it also assists in the task of pushing information packets on to their destinations. It seems that this contribution to the system outweighs the burdens imposed upon it. 
\par The network has a growth potential which is always bigger than the number of its use
rs. It is as though television sets assisted in passing the signals received by them to other television sets. Every computer which is a member of the network is both a message (content) and a medium (active information channel), both a transmitter and a 
receiver. If 30% of all computers on the Net were to crash - there will be no operational impact (there is enormous built in redundancy). Obviously, some contents will no longer be available (information channels will be affected). 
\par The interactivity of thi
s medium is a guarantee against the monopolization of contents. Anyone with a thousand dollars can launch his/her own (reasonably sophisticated) site, accessible to all other Internet users. Space is available through home page providers. 
\par The name of the game is no longer the production - it is the creative content (design), the content itself and, above all, the marketing of the site. 
\par The Internet is an infinite and unlimited resource. This goes against the grain of the most basic economic concept (of sc
arcity). Each computer that joins the Internet strengthens it exponentially - and tens of thousands join daily. The Internet infrastructure (maybe with the exception of communication backbones) can accommodate an annual growth of 100% to the year 2020. It
 
is the user who decides whether to increase the Internet's infrastructure by connecting his computer to it. By comparison: it is as though it were possible to produce and to broadcast radio programmes from every radio receiver. Each computer is a combinat
ion of studio and transmitter (on the Internet). 
\par In reality, there is no other interactive medium except the Internet. Cable TV does not allow two-way data transfer (from user to cable operator). If the user wants to buy a product - he has to phone. Intera
ctive television is an abject failure (the Sony and TCI experiments were terminated). This all is notwithstanding the combining of the Internet with satellite capabilities (VSAT) or with the revenant digital television. 
\par The television screen is inferior when compared to the computer screen. Only the Internet is there as a true two-way possibility. The technological problems that besieged it are slowly dissipating. 
\par The Internet allows for one-dimensional and bi - dimensional interactivity. 
\par One-dimensional interactivity: fill in and dispatch a form, send and receive messages (through e-mail or v-mail). 
\par Two-dimensional interactivity: to talk to someone while both parties work on an application, to see your conversant, to talk to him and to transfer documents to him for his perusal as the conversation continues apace. 
\par This is no longer science fiction. In less than five years this will be as common as the telephone - and it will have a profound effect on the traditional services provided by the phone compani
es. Internet phones, Internet videophones - they will be serious competitors and the phone companies are likely to react once they begin to feel the heat. This will happen when the Internet will acquire black box features. Phone companies, software giants
 and cable TV operators are likely to end up owning big chunks of the lucrative future market of the Net. 
\par }{\b\i The Solitary Medium}{ 
\par The Internet is NOT a popular medium. It is the medium of affluent executives who fully master the English language, as part of a wider general education. 
\par Alternatively, it is the medium of academia (students, lecturers), or of children of the former, well-to-do group. In any case, it is not the medium of the "wide public". It is also a highly individualistic medium. 
\par The Internet 
was an initiative of the DOD (Department of Defence in the USA). It was later "requisitioned" by the National science Fund (NSF) in the USA. This continuous involvement of the administration came to an end in 1995 when the medium was "privatized". 
\par This "p
rivatization" was a recognition of the civilian roots of the Internet. It was - and is still being - formed by millions of information-intoxicated users. They formed networks to exchange bits and pieces of mutual interest. Thus, as opposed to all other me
d
ia, the Internet was not invented, nor was its market. The inventors of the telephone, the telegraph, the radio, the television and the compact disc - all invented previously non-existent markets for their products. It took time, effort and money to convi
nce consumers that they needed these "gadgets". 
\par By contrast, the Internet was invented by its own consumers and so was the market for it. Only when the latter was fully forged did producers and businessmen join in. Microsoft began to hesitantly test the internet waters only in 1995! 
\par }{\b\i On Line Memories}{ 
\par The Internet is the only medium with online memory, very much like the human brain. The memories of these two - the Net a
nd the Brain - are immediately accessible. In both, it is stored in sites and in both, it does not grow old or is eliminated. It is possible to find sites which commemorate events the same way that the human mind registers them. This is Net Memory. The hi
s
tory of a site can be reviewed. The Library of Congress stores the consecutive development phases of sites. The Internet is an amazing combination of data processing software, data, a record of all the activities which took place in connection with the da
ta and the memory of these records. Only the human brain is recalled by these capacities: one language serves all these functions, the language of the neurones. 
\par There is a much clearer distinction even in computers (not to mention more conventional media, such as television). 
\par }{\b\i Raw English - the Language of Raw Materials}{ 
\par The following - apparently trivial - observation is critical: 
\par All the other media provide us with processed, censored, "clean" content. 
\par The Internet is a medium of raw materials, partly well organized (the rough equivalent of a newspaper) - and partly still in raw form, yesterday\rquote s supper. 
\par This is a result of the immediate and absolute access afforded each user: access to programming and site publishing tools - as well as access to comput
er space on servers. This leads to varying degrees of quality of contents and content providers and this, in turn, prevents monopolization and cartelization of the information supply channels. 
\par The users of the Internet are still undecided: do they prefer 
drafts or newspapers. They frequent well designed sites. There are even design competitions and awards. But they display a preference for sites that are constantly updated (i.e. closer in their nature to a raw material - rather than to a finished product)
. They prefer sites from which they can download material to quietly process at home, alone, on their PCs, at their leisure. 
\par Even the concept of "interactivity" points at a preference for raw materials with which one can interact. For what is interactivity if not the active involvement of the user in the creation of content? 
\par The Internet users love to be involved, to feel the power in their fingertips, they are all addicted to one form of power or another. 
\par Similarly, a car completely automatically driven and navigated is not likely to sell well. Part of the experience of driving - the sensation of power ("power stirring") - is critical to the purchase decision. 
\par It is not in vain that the metaphor for using the Internet is "surfing" (and not, let\rquote s say, browsing). 
\par The problem is that the Internet is still predominantly an English language medium (though it is fast changing). It discriminates against those whose mother tongue is different. All software applications work best in English. Otherwise they have 
to be adapted and fitted with special fonts (Hebrew, Arabic, Japanese, Russian and Chinese - each present a different set of problems to overcome). This situation might change with the attainment of a critical mass of users (some say, 2 million per non-An
glophone country). 
\par }{\b\i Comprehensive (Virtual) Reality}{ 
\par This is the first (though, probably, not the last) medium which allows the user to conduct his whole life within its boundaries. 
\par Television presents a clear division: there is a passive viewer. His task is to absorb information and subject it to minimal processing. The Internet embodies a complete and comprehensive (virtual) reality, a full fledged alternative to real life. 
\par The illusion is still in its infancy - and yet already powerful. 
\par The user can talk to others, see them, listen to music, see video, purchase goods and services, play games (alone or with others scattered around the globe), converse with colleagues, or with users
 with the same hobbies and areas of interest, to play music together (separated by time and space). 
\par And all this is very primitive. In ten years time, the Internet will offer its users the option of video conferencing (possibly, three dimensional, holographic). The participants\rquote 
 figures will be projected on big screens. Documents will be exchanged, personal notes, spreadsheets, secret counteroffers. 
\par Virtual Reality games will become reality in less time. Special end-user equipment will make the player bel
ieve that he, actually, is part of the game (while still in his room). The player will be able to select an image borrowed from a database and it will represent him, seen by all the other players. Everyone will, thus, end up invading everyone else\rquote 
s private space - without encroaching on his privacy! 
\par The Internet will be the medium of choice for phone and videophone communication (including conferencing). 
\par Many mundane activities will be done through Internet: banking, shopping for standard items, etc. 
\par The above are examples to the Internet's power and ability to replace our reality in due time. A world out there will continue to exist - but, more and more we will interact with it through the enchanted interface of the Net.

 of a medium in the making is difficult to predict. Suffice it to mention the ridiculous prognoses which accompanied the PC (it is nothing but a gaming gadget, it is a replacement for the electric typewriter, will be used only by business). The telephone 
a
lso had its share of ludicrous statements: no one - claimed the "experts" would like to avoid eye contact while talking. Or television: only the Nazi regime seemed to have fully grasped its potential (in the Berlin 1936 Olympics). And Bill Gates thought t
hat the internet has a very limited future as late as 1995!!! 
\par Still, this medium has a few characteristics which differentiate it from all its predecessors. Were these traits to be continuously and creatively exploited - a few statements can be made about the future of the Net with relative assurance. 
\par }{\b\i Time and Space Independence}{ 
\par This is the first medium in history which does not require the simultaneous presence of people in space-time in order to facilitate the transfer of information. Televisi
on requires the existence of studio technicians, narrators and others in the transmitting side - and the availability of a viewer in the receiving side. The phone is dependent on the existence of two or more parties simultaneously. 
\par With time, tools to bri
dge the time gap between transmitter and receiver were developed. The answering machine and the video cassette recorder both accumulate information sent by a transmitter - and release it to a receiver in a different space and time. But they are discrete, 
their storage volume is limited and they do not allow for interaction with the transmitter. 
\par The Internet does not have these handicaps. 
\par It facilitates the formation of "virtual organizations / institutions / businesses/ communities". These are groups of users that communicate in different points in space and time, united by a common goal or interest. 
\par A few examples: 
\par }{\b\i The Virtual Advertising Agency}{ 
\par A budget executive from the USA will manage the account of a hi-tech firm based in Sydney. He will work with
 technical experts from Israel and with a French graphics office. They will all file their work (through the intranet) in the Net, to be studied by the other members of this virtual group. These will enter the right site after clearing a firewall security
 software. They will all be engaged in flexiwork (flexible working times) and work from their homes or offices, as they please. Obviously, they will all abide by a general schedule. 
\par They will exchange audio files (the jingle, for instance), graphics, video, colour photographs and text. They will comment on each other\rquote 
s work and make suggestions using e-mail. The client will witness the whole creative process and will be able to contribute to it. There is no technological obstacle preventing the participation of the client\rquote s clients, as well. 
\par }{\b\i Virtual Rock\rquote n\rquote Roll}{ 
\par It is difficult to imagine that "virtual performances will replace real life ones. 
\par The mass rock concert has its own inimitable sounds, palette and smells. But a virtual production of a record is o
n the cards and it is tens of percents cheaper than a normal production. Again, the participants will interact through the Intranet. They will swap notes, play their own instruments, make comments by e-mail, play together using an appropriate software. If
 
one of them is grabbed by inspiration in the middle of (his) night, he will be able to preserve and pass on his ideas through the Net. The creative process will be aided by novel applications which enable the simultaneous transfer of sound over the Net. T
he processes which are already digitized (the mix, for one) will pose no problem to a digitized medium. Other applications will let the users listen to the final versions and even ask the public for his preview opinion. 
\par Thus, even creative processes which are perceived as demanding human presence - will no longer do so with the advent of the Net. 
\par Perhaps it is easier to understand a }{\b\i Virtual Law Firm or Virtual Accountants Office}{\i .}{ 
\par In the extreme, such a firm will not have physical offices, at all. The only
 address will be an e-mail address. Dozens of lawyers from all over the world with hundreds of specialities will be partners in such an office. Such an office will be truly multinational and multidisciplinary. It will be fast and effective because its mem
bers will electronically swap information (precedents, decrees, laws, opinions, research and plain ideas or professional experience). 
\par It will be able to service clients in every corner of the globe. It will involve the transfer of audio files (NetPhones), 
text, graphics and video (crucial in certain types of litigation). Today, such information is sent by post and messenger services. Whenever different types of information are to be analysed - a physical meeting is a must. Otherwise, each type of informati
on has to be transferred separately, using unique equipment for each one. 
\par Simultaneity and interactivity - this will be the name of the game in the Internet. The professional term is "Coopetition" (cooperation between potential competitors, using the Internet). 
\par Other possibilities: a virtual production of a movie, a virtual research and development team, a virtual sales force. The harbingers of the virtual university, the virtual classroom and the virtual (or distance) medical centre are here. 
\par }{\b\i The Internet - Mother of all Media}{ 
\par The Internet is the technological solution to the mythological "home entertainment centre" debate. 
\par It is almost universally agreed that, in the future, a typical home will have one apparatus which will give it access to all types 
of information. Even the most daring did not talk about simultaneous access to all the types of information or about full interactivity. 
\par The Internet will offer exactly this: access to every conceivable type of information simultaneously , the ability to 
process them at the same time and full interactivity. The future image of this home centre is fairly clear - it is the timing that is not. It is all dependent on the availability of a wide (information) band - through which it will be possible to transfer
 
big amounts of data at high speeds, using the same communications line. Fast modems were coupled with optic fibres and with faulty planning and vision of future needs. The cable television industry, for instance, is totally technologically unprepared for 
the age of interactivity. This is only partly the result of unwise, restrictive, legislation which prohibits data vendors from stepping on each others\rquote 
 toes. Phone companies were not permitted to provide Internet services or to transfer video through their wires - and cable companies were not allowed to transmit phone calls. 
\par It is a question of time until these fossilized remains are removed by the almighty hand of the market. When this happens, the home centre is likely to look like this: 
\par A central comput
er attached to a big screen divided to windows. Television is broadcast on one window. A software application is running on another. This could be an application connected to the television program (deriving data from it, recording it, collating it with p
ertinent data it picks out of databases). It could be an independent application (a computer game). 
\par Updates from the New York Stock exchange flash at the corner of the screen and an icon blinks to signal the occurrence of a significant economic event. 
\par A c
lick of the mouse (?) and the news flash is converted to a voice message. Another click and your broker is on the InternetPhone (possibly seen in a third window on the screen). You talk, you send him a fax containing instructions and you compare notes. Th
e fax was printed on a word processing application which opened up in yet another window. 
\par Many believe that communication with the future generation of computers will be voice communication. This is difficult to believe. It is weird to talk to a machine (e
specially in the presence of other humans). We are seriously inhibited this way. Moreover, voice will interrupt other people\rquote 
s work or pleasure. It is also close to impossible to develop an efficient voice recognition software. Not to mention mishaps such as accidental activation. 
\par }{\b\i The Friendly Internet}{ 
\par The Internet will not escape the processes experienced by all other media. 
\par It will become easy to operate, user-friendly, in professional parlance. 
\par It requires too much specialized information. It is not accessible to those who lack basic hardware and (Windows) software concepts. 
\par Alas, most of the population falls into the latter category. Only 30 million "Windows" operating systems were sold worldwide at
 the end of 1996. Even if this constitutes 20% of all the copies (the rest being pirated versions) - it still represents less than 3% of the population of the world. And this, needless to say, is the world's most popular software (following the DOS operat
ing system). 
\par The Internet must rely on something completely different. It must have sophisticated, transparent-to-the-user search engines to guide to the cavernous chaotic libraries which will typify it. The search engines must include complex decision mak
ing algorithms. They must understand common languages and respond in mundane speech. They will be efficient and incredibly fast because they will form their own search strategy (supplanting the user\rquote s faulty use of syntax). 
\par These engines, replete with smart agents will refer the user to additional data, to cultural products which reflect the user\rquote 
s history of preferences (or pronounced preferences expressed in answers to feedback questionnaires). All the decisions and activities of the user will be stored 
in the memory of his search engine and assist it in designing its decision making trees. The engine will become an electronic friend, advise the user, even on professional matters. 
\par }{\b\i Cease-Fire}{ 
\par The cessation of hostilities between the Internet and some off
-the-shelf software applications heralds the commencement of the integration between the desktop computer and the Net. This is a small step for the user - and a big one for humanity. The animosity which prevailed until recently between the UNIX systems an
d
 the HTML language and between most of the standard applications (headed by the Word Processors) - has officially ended with the introduction of Office 97 which incorporates full HTML capabilities. With the Office 2000 products, the distinctions between a
 web computing environment and a PC computing one - have all but vanished. Browsers can replace operating systems, word processors can browse, download and upload - the PC has finally been entirely absorbed by its offspring, the internet. 
\par The Portable Document Format (PDF) enables the user to work the Internet off-line. In other words: text files will be loaded to word processors and edited off-line. The same applies to other types of files (audio, video). 
\par Downloading time will be speeded up (today, it takes so long to download an audio or video file that, many times, it is impracticable). 
\par This is not a trivial matter. The ability to switch between on-line and off-line states and to continue the work, uninterrupted - this ability means the integration of the PC in the Internet. 
\par There are two competing views concerning the future of computer hardware and both of them acknowledge the importance of the Internet. 
\par Bill Gates - Microsoft\rquote s legendary boss - says that the PC will continue to advance and strengthe
n its processing and computing powers. The Internet will be just another tool available through telecommunications, rather than through the ownership of hard copies of software and data. The Internet is perceived to be a tremendous external database, avai
lable for processing by tomorrow\rquote s desktops. This view is lately being gradually reversed in view of the incredible vitality and powers of the Internet. 
\par Gates is converging on the worldview held by Sun Microsystems. 
\par The future desktop will be a terminal, 
albeit powerful and with considerable processing, computing and communications capabilities. The name of the game will be the Internet itself. The terminal will access Internet databases (containing raw or processed data) and satisfy its information needs
. 
\par This terminal - equipped with languages the likes of Java - will get into libraries of software applications. It will make use of components of different applications as the needs arise. When finished using the component, the terminal will "return" it to
 the virtual "shelf" until the next time it is needed. 
\par This will minimize memory resources in the desktop. 
\par The truth, as always, is probably somewhere in the middle. 
\par Tomorrow\rquote s computer will be a home entertainment centre. No consumer will accept total dependence on telecommunications and on the Net. They will all ask for processing and computing powers at their fingertips, a-la Bill Gates. 
\par But tomorrow\rquote s computer will also function as a terminal, when needed: when data retrieving or even when using NON
 standard software applications. Why purchase rarely used, expensive applications - when they are available, for a fraction of the cost, on the Net? 
\par In other words: no consumer will subjugate his frequent word processing needs to the whims of the local ph
one company, or to those of the site operator. That is why every desktop is still likely to be include a hard (or optical)-disk-resident word processing software. But very few will by CAD-CAM, animation, graphics, or publishing software which they are lik
ely to use infrequently. Instead, they will access these applications, which will be resident in the Net, use those parts that are needed. This is usage tailored to the client\rquote 
s needs. This is also the integration of a desktop (not of a terminal) with the Net. 
\par }{\b\i Decentralized Lack of Planning}{ 
\par The course adopted by content creators (producers) in the last few years proves the maxim that it is easy to repeat mistakes and difficult to derive lessons from them. Content producers are constantly buying channels to
 transfer their contents. This is a mistake. A careful study of the history of successful media (e.g., television) points to a clear pattern: 
\par Content producers do not grant life-long exclusivity to any single channel. Especially not by buying into it. The
y prefer to contract for a limited time with content providers (their broadcast channels). They work with all of them, sometimes simultaneously. 
\par In the future, the same content will be sold on different sites or networks, at different times. Sometimes it 
will be found with a provider which is a combination of cable TV company and phone company - at other times, it will be found with a provider with expertise in computer networks. Much content will be created locally and distributed globally - and vice ver
sa. The repackaging of branded contents will be the name of the game in both the media firms and the firms which control contents distribution (=the channels). 
\par No exclusivity pact will survive. Networks such as CompuServe are doomed and have been doomed since 1993. The approach of decentralized access, through numerous channels, to the same information - will prevail. 
\par }{\b\i The Transparent Language}{ 
\par The Internet will become the next battlefield between have countries and have-not countries. It will be a cultural
 war zone (English against French, Japanese, Chinese, Russian and Spanish). It will be politically charged: those wishing to restrict the freedom of speech (authoritarian and dictatorial regimes, governments, conservative politicians) against pro-speecher
s. It will become a new arena of warfare and an integral part of actual wars. 
\par Different peer groups, educational and income social-economic strata, ethnic, sexual preference groups - will all fight in the eternal fields of the Internet. 
\par Yet, two developments are likely to pacify the scene: 
\par Automatic translation applications (like Accent and the Alta Vista translation engines) will make every bit of information accessible to all. The lingual (and, by extension ethnic or national) source of the information will be disguised. A feeling of a gl
obal village will permeate the medium. Being ignorant of the English language will no longer hinder one\rquote s access to the Net. Equal opportunities. 
\par The second trend will be the new classification methods of contents on the Net together with the availability 
of chips intended to filter offensive information. Obscene material will not be available to tender souls. anti-Semitic sites will be blocked to Jews and communists will be spared Evil Empire speeches. Filtering will be usually done using extensive and ad
aptable lists of keywords or key phrases. 
\par This will lead to the formation of cultural Internet Ghettos - but it will also considerably reduce tensions and largely derail populist legislative efforts aimed at curbing or censoring free speech. 
\par }{\b\i Public Internet - Private Internet}{ 
\par The day is not far when every user will be able to define his areas of interest, order of priorities, preferences and tastes. Special applications will scour the Net for him and retrieve the material befitting his requirements. This 
material will be organized in any manner prescribed. 
\par A private newspaper comes to mind. It will have a circulation of one copy - the user\rquote s. It will borrow its contents from a few hundreds of databases and electronic versions of newspapers on the Net. Its
 headlines will reflect the main areas of interest of its sole subscriber. The private paper will contain hyperlinks to other sites in the Internet: to reference material, to additional information on the same subject. It will contain text, but also graph
ics, audio, video and photographs. It will be interactive and editable with the push of a button. 
\par Another idea: the intelligent archive. 
\par The user will accumulate information, derived from a variety of sources in an archive maintained for him on the Net. I
t will not be a classical "dead" archive. It will be active. A special application will search the Net daily and update the archive. It will contain hyperlinks to sites, to additional information on the Net and to alternative sources of information. It wi
ll have a "History" function which will teach the archive about the preferences and priorities of the user. 
\par The software will recommend new sites to him and subjects similar to his history. It will alert him to movies, TV shows and new musical releases - a
ll within his cultural sphere. If convinced to purchase - the software will order the wares from the Net. It will then let him listen to the music, see the movie, or read the text. 
\par The internet will become a place of unceasing stimuli, of internal order a
nd organization and of friendliness in the sense of personally rewarding acquaintance. Such an archive will be a veritable friend. It will alert the user to interesting news, leave messages and food for thought in his e-mail (or v-mail). It will send the 
user a fax if not responded to within a reasonable time. It will issue reports every morning. 
\par This, naturally, is only a private case of the archival potential of the Net. 
\par A network connecting more than 16.3 million computers (end 1996) is also the bigges
t collective memory effort in history after the Library of Alexandria. The Internet possesses the combined power of all its constituents. Search engines are, therefore, bound to be replaced by intelligent archives which will form universal archives, which
 will store all the paths to the results of searches plus millions of recommended searches. 
\par Compare this to a newspaper: it is much easier to store back issues of a paper in the Internet than physically. Obviously, it is much easier to search and the amort
ization of such a copy is annulled. Such an archive will let the user search by word, by key phrase, by contents, search the bibliography and hop to other parts of the archive or to other territories in the Internet using hyperlinks. 
\par }{\b\i Money, Again}{ 
\par We have
 already mentioned SET, the safety standard. This will facilitate credit card transactions over the Net. These are safe transactions even today - but there an ingrained interest to say otherwise. Newspapers are afraid that advertising budgets will migrate
 
to the Web. Television harbours the same fears. More commerce on the Net - means more advertising dollars diverted from established media. Too many feel unhappy when confronted with this inevitability. They spread lies which feed off the ignorance about h
ow safe paying with credit cards on the Net is. Safety standards will terminate this propaganda and transform the Internet into a commercial medium. 
\par Users will be able to buy and sell goods and services on the Net and get them by post. Certain things will 
be directly downloaded (software, e-books). Many banking transactions and EDI operations will be conducted through bank-clients intranets. All stock and commodity exchanges will be accessible and the role of brokers will be minimized. Foreign exchange wil
l
 be easily tradable and transferable. Initial Public Offerings of shares, day trading of stocks and other activities traditionally connected with physical ("pit") capital markets will become a predominant feature of the internet. The day is not far that t
h
e likes of Merill Lynch will be offering full services (including advisory services) through the internet. The first steps towards electronic trading of shares (with discounted fees) have already been taken in mid 1999. Home banking, private newspapers, s
ubscriptions to cultural events, tourism packages and airline tickets - are all candidates for Net-Trading. 
\par The Internet is here to stay. 
\par Commercially, it would be an extreme strategic error to ignore it. A lot of money will flow through it. A lot more people will be connected to it. A lot of information will be stored on it. 
\par It is worth being there.

sional articles are "print" - and so are the sleaziest porno brochures. 
\par So, first, I think it would be useful to make a distinction between two broad categories: 
\par Content-related\line or\line Content-driven and Interaction-driven 
\par Most content driven sites maintain
 reasonable ethical standards, roughly comparable to the "real" or "non-virtual" media. This is because many of these sites were established by businesses with a "real" dimension to start with (Walt Disney, The Economist, etc.). These sites (at least the 
institutional ones) maintain standards of privacy, veracity, cross-checking of information, etc. 
\par Personal home pages would be a sub-category of content-driven sites. These cannot be seriously considered "media". They are representatives of the new phenomen
on of extreme narrowcasting. They do not adhere to any ethical standards, with the exception of those upheld by their owners'. 
\par The interaction orientated sites and activities can, in turn, be divided to E-commerce sites (such as Amazon) which adhere to commercial law and to commercial ethics and to interactive sites. 
\par The latter - discussion lists, mailing lists and so on - are a hotbed of unethical, verbally aggressive, hostile behaviour. A special vocabulary developed to discuss these phenomena ("flaming", "mail bombing" etc.). 
\par To summarize: 
\par Where the aim is to provide consumers with another venue for the dissemination of information or to sell products or services to them the standards of ethics maintained reflect those upheld outside the realm of th
e internet. Additionally, codified morals, the commercial law is adhered to. 
\par Where the aim is interaction or the dissemination of the personal opinions and views of site-owners - ethical standards are in the process of becoming. A rough set of guidelines 
coalesced into the "netiquette". It is a set of rules of peaceful co-existence intended to prevent flame wars and the eruption of interpersonal verbal abuse. Since it lacks effective means of enforcement - it is very often violated and constitutes an expr
ession of goodwill, rather than an obliging code.

Though the countries in transition are far from being an homogeneous lot, there are a few denominators common to their Internet experience hitherto: 
\par 1. }{\b\cf1\lang2057\langfe2057\langnp2057\langfenp2057 Internet Invasion }{\cf1\lang2057\langfe2057\langnp2057\langfenp2057 
\par The penetration of the Internet in the countries in transition varies from country to country - but is still very low even by European standards, not to mention by American ones. This had to do with the lack 
of infrastructure, the prohibitive cost of services, an extortionist pricing structure, computer illiteracy and luddism (computer phobia). Societies in the countries in transition are inert (and most of them, conservative or traditionalist) - following ye
ars of central mis-planning. The Internet (and computers) are perceived by many as threatening - mainly because they are part of a technological upheaval which makes people redundant. 
\par 2. }{\b\cf1\lang2057\langfe2057\langnp2057\langfenp2057 The Rumour Mill}{\cf1\lang2057\langfe2057\langnp2057\langfenp2057  
\par All manner of instant messaging - mainly the earlier
 versions of IRC - played an important role in enhancing social cohesion and exchanging uncensored information. As in other parts of the world - the Internet was first used to communicate: IRC, MIRC e-mail and e-mail fora were - and to a large extent, are
 - all the rage. 
\par The IRC was (and is) used mainly to exchange political views and news and to engage in inter-personal interactions. The media in countries in transition is notoriously unreliable. Decades of official indoctrination and propaganda left peop
le reading between (real or imaginary) lines. Rumours and gossip always substituted for news and the Internet was well suited to become a prime channel of dissemination of conspiracy theories, malicious libel, hearsay and eyewitness accounts. Instant mess
a
ging services also led to an increase in the number (though not necessarily in the quality) of interactions between the users - from dating to the provision of services, the Internet was enthusiastically adopted by a generation of alienated youth, isolate
d
 from the world by official doctrine and from each other by paranoia fostered by the political regime. The Internet exposed its users to the west, to other models of existence where trust and collaboration play a major role. It increase the quantity of in
t
eraction between them. It fostered a sense of identity and community. The Internet is not ubiquitous in the countries in transition and, therefore, its impact is very limited. It had no discernible effect on how governments work in this region. Even in th
e USA it is just starting to effect political processes and be integrated in them. 
\par The Internet encouraged entrepreneurship and aspirations of social mobility. Very much like mobile telephony - which allowed the countries in transition to skip massive inve
stments in outdated technologies - the Internet was perceived to be a shortcut to prosperity. Its decentralized channels of distribution, global penetration, "rags to riches" ethos and dizzying rate of innovation - attracted the young and creative. Many d
e
cided to become software developers and establish local version of "Silicon Valley" or the flourishing software industry in India. Anti virus software was developed in Russia, web design services in former Yugoslavia, e-media in the Czech Republic and so 
on. But this is the reserve of a minuscule part of society. E-commerce, for instance, is a long way off (though m-commerce might be sooner in countries like the Czech Republic or the Baltic). 
\par E-commerce is the natural culmination of a process. You need to 
have a rich computer infrastructure, a functioning telecommunications network, cheap access to the Internet, computer literacy, inability to postpone gratification, a philosophy of consumerism and, finally, a modicum of trust between the players in the ec
o
nomy. The countries in transition lack all of the above. Most of them are not even aware that the Internet exists and what it can do for them. Penetration rates, number of computers per household, number of phone lines per household, the reliability of th
e
 telecommunications infrastructure and the number of Internet users at home (and at work)- are all dismally low. On the other hand, the cost of accessing the net is still prohibitively high. It would be a wild exaggeration to call the budding Internet ent
e
rprises in the countries in transition - "industries". There are isolated cases of success, that's all. They sprang in response to local demand, expanded internationally on rare occasions and, on the whole remained pretty confined to their locale. There w
as no agreement between countries and entrepreneurs who will develop what. It was purely haphazard. 
\par 3. }{\b\cf1\lang2057\langfe2057\langnp2057\langfenp2057 The Great Equalizer}{\cf1\lang2057\langfe2057\langnp2057\langfenp2057  
\par Very early on, the denizens of the countries in transition have caught on to the "great equalizer" effects of the Net. They used it 
to vent their frustrations and aggression, to conduct cyber-warfare, to unleash an explosion of visual creativity and to engage in deconstructive discourse. 
\par By great equalizer - I meant equalizer with the rich, developed countries. See the article I quote
d above. The citizens of the countries in transition are frustrated by their inability to catch up with the affluence and prosperity of the West. They feel inferior, neglected, looked down upon, dictated to and, in general, put down. The Internet is perce
i
ved as something which can restore the balance. Only, of course, it cannot. It is still a rich people's medium. President Clinton points out the Digital Divide within America - such a divide exists to a much larger extent and with more venomous effects be
t
ween the developed and developing world. the Internet has done nothing to bridge this gap - on the contrary: It enhanced the productivity and economic growth (this is known as "The New Economy") of rich countries (mainly the States) and left the have-nots
 in the dust. 
\par 4. }{\b\cf1\lang2057\langfe2057\langnp2057\langfenp2057 Intellectual Property}{\cf1\lang2057\langfe2057\langnp2057\langfenp2057  
\par The concept of intellectual property - foreign to the global Internet culture to start with - became an emblem of Western hegemony and monopolistic practices. Violating copyright, software piracy and hacking became b
oth status symbols and a political declaration of sorts. But the rapid dissemination of programs and information (for instance, illicit copies of reference works) served to level the playing field. 
\par Piracy of material is quite prevalent in the countries in
 transition. The countries in transition are the second capital of piracy (after Asia). Software, films, even books - are copied and distributed quite freely and openly. There are street vendors who deal in the counterfeit products - but most of it is sol
d through stores and OEMs. 
\par I think that intellectual property will go the way the pharmaceutical industry did: Instead of fighting windmills - owners and distributors of intellectual property will join the trend. They are likely to team up with sponsors wh
ich will subsidize the price of intellectual property in order to make it affordable to the denizens of poor countries. Such sponsors could be either multi-lateral institutions (such as the World Bank) - or charities and donors.

The Selfish Net \endash  The Semantic Web}{\fs28 
\par }{\b\i\fs28 {\*\bkmkend selfish}By: Sam Vaknin
\par }{A decade after the invention of the World Wide Web, Tim Berners-Lee is promoting the "Semantic Web". The Internet hitherto is a repository of digital content. It has a rudimentary inventory system and very crude data 
location services. As a sad result, most of the content is invisible and inaccessible. Moreover, the Internet manipulates strings of symbols, not logical or semantic propositions. In other words, the Net compares values but does not know the meaning of th
e
 values it thus manipulates. It is unable to interpret strings, to infer new facts, to deduce, induce, derive, or otherwise comprehend what it is doing. In short, it does not understand language. Run an ambiguous term by any search engine and these shortc
o
mings become painfully evident. This lack of understanding of the semantic foundations of its raw material (data, information) prevent applications and databases from sharing resources and feeding each other. The Internet is discrete, not continuous. It r
esembles an archipelago, with users hopping from island to island in a frantic search for relevancy.
\par Even visionaries like Berners-Lee do not contemplate an "intelligent Web". They are simply proposing to let users, content creators,\~ and web developers ass
ign descriptive meta-tags ("name of hotel") to fields, or to strings of symbols ("Hilton"). These meta-tags (arranged in semantic and relational "ontologies" - lists of metatags, their meanings and how they relate to each other) will be read by various ap
p
lications and allow them to process the associated strings of symbols correctly (place the word "Hilton" in your address book under "hotels"). This will make information retrieval more efficient and reliable and the information retrieved is bound to be mo
r
e relevant and amenable to higher level processing (statistics, the development of heuristic rules, etc.). The shift is from HTML (whose tags are concerned with visual appearances and content indexing) to languages such as the DARPA Agent Markup Language,
 OIL (Ontology Inference Layer or Ontology Interchange Language), or even XML (whose tags are concerned with content taxonomy, document structure, and semantics). This would bring the Internet closer to the classic library card catalogue.
\par Even in its current, pre-semantic, hyperlink-dependent, phase, the Internet brings to mind Richard Dawkins' seminal work "The Selfish Gene" (OUP, 1976). This would be doubly true for the Semantic Web.
\par Dawkins suggested to generalize the principle of natura
l selection to a law of the survival of the stable. "A stable thing is a collection of atoms which is permanent enough or common enough to deserve a name". He then proceeded to describe the emergence of "Replicators" - molecules which created copies of th
e
mselves. The Replicators that survived in the competition for scarce raw materials were characterized by high longevity, fecundity, and copying-fidelity. Replicators (now known as "genes") constructed "survival machines" (organisms) to shield them from th
e vagaries of an ever-harsher environment.
\par This is very reminiscent of the Internet. The "stable things" are HTML coded web pages. They are replicators - they create copies of themselves every time their "web address" (URL) is clicked. The HTML coding of a 
web page can be thought of as "genetic material". It contains all the information needed to reproduce the page. And, exactly as in nature, the higher the longevity, fecundity (measured in links to the web page from other web sites), and copying-fidelity o
f the HTML code - the higher its chances to survive (as a web page).
\par Replicator molecules (DNA) and replicator HTML have one thing in common - they are both packaged information. In the appropriate context (the right biochemical "soup" in the case of DNA, t
he right software application in the case of HTML code) - this information generates a "survival machine" (organism, or a web page). 
\par The Semantic Web will only increase the longevity, fecundity, and copying-fidelity or the underlying code (in this case, O
IL or XML instead of HTML). By facilitating many more interactions with many other web pages and databases - the underlying "replicator" code will ensure the "survival" of "its" web page (=its survival machine). In this analogy, the web page's "DNA" (its 
OIL or XML code) contains "single genes" (semantic meta-tags). The whole process of life is the unfolding of a kind of Semantic Web.
\par In a prophetic paragraph, Dawkins described the Internet:
\par "The first thing to grasp about a modern replicator is that it is 
highly gregarious. A survival machine is a vehicle containing not just one gene but many thousands. The manufacture of a body is a cooperative venture of such intricacy that it is almost impossible to disentangle the contribution of one gene from that of 
a
nother. A given gene will have many different effects on quite different parts of the body. A given part of the body will be influenced by many genes and the effect of any one gene depends on interaction with many others...In terms of the analogy, any giv
en page of the plans makes reference to many different parts of the building; and each page makes sense only in terms of cross-reference to numerous other pages"
\par What Dawkins neglected in his important work is the concept of the Network. People congregate i
n cities, mate, and reproduce, thus providing genes with new "survival machines". But Dawkins himself suggested that the new Replicator is the "meme" - an idea, belief, technique, technology, work of art, or bit of information. Memes use human brains as "
s
urvival machines" and they hop from brain to brain and across time and space ("communications") in the process of cultural (as distinct from biological) evolution. The Internet is a latter day meme-hopping playground. But, more importantly, it is a Networ
k
. Genes move from one container to another through a linear, serial, tedious process which involves prolonged periods of one on one gene shuffling ("sex") and gestation. Memes use networks. Their propagation is, therefore, parallel, fast, and all-pervasiv
e. The Internet is a manifestation of the growing predominance of memes over genes. And the Semantic Web may be to the Internet what Artificial Intelligence is to classic computing. We may be on the threshold of a self-aware Web.
